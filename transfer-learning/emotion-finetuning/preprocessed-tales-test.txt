"alas! said he to his wife, ""what ill luck has befallen me! --my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three dead."" </br>"	A:A
the conversation on this topic was only interrupted for a moment by the arrival of a newspaper, which did not, however, contain much worth reading, and while it is still going on we will pay a visit to the ante-room, in which cloaks, sticks, and goloshes were carefully placed. </br>	N:N
all the sparrows, and even a crow- and an old boy he was too- were startled at the sight; but still they flew after her to learn what kind of strange bird she was. </br>	Su+:Su+
"ah, father, said hansel, ""i am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me."" </br>"	N:N
come in! and how do you do, my dear duchess? cried ribby. </br>	H:N
"then said the bailiff to his wife, ""the servant is a good one, if he does sleep long, he is still home before the others."" </br>"	H:N
"we were invited to partake; and as i sat by the fire, a boy, older than myself, put his arms round my neck, and kissed me, and said, ""christ is risen."" </br>"	N:N
one of them knew the whole latin dictionary by heart, and three whole years of the daily paper of the little town into the bargain, and so well, indeed, that he could repeat it all either backwards or forwards, just as he chose. </br>	N:N
the beer ran into the jug and catherine stood looking on. </br>	N:N
hereupon the king was angry, and ordered him to be put in prison at once, because he thought he must have done some injury to the children. </br>	A:A
so she took the doll out, who looked quite cross, and said not a single word, for she was angry at being turned out of her bed. </br>	A:A
"then he asked: ""why are you weeping?"" </br>"	Sa:Su-
they went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red brick wall. </br>	N:N
"it is the bird""s heart that will bring you this good luck."" </br>"	H:N
ribby went into the shop and bought what she required, and came out, after a pleasant gossip with cousin tabitha twitchit. </br>	N:H
she lived three days more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. </br>	H:H
thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her from view. </br>	N:N
the cock has crowed; we must start before the hens come out; they might shout to mr. piperson. </br>	N:N
he was of a wandering habit and he had foxy whiskers; they never knew where he would be next. </br>	N:N
"then he took the prince""s coat, and gave him the shabby one, and went away through the wood. </br>"	N:N
the king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but they did not find him. </br>	F:N
but where are you? said they. </br>	N:Su-
those who walked outside the town, where the houses were less crowded and interspersed by gardens and little fields, saw the evening sky much better, and heard the sound of the bell much more clearly. </br>	N:N
"the bear was about to set at the little fellow at once, and give him a hearty welcome with his paws: ""softly, softly,"" said the little tailor, ""i will soon make thee quiet."" </br>"	N:A
"then a little cart passed by and said, ""why art thou sweeping, little broom?"" </br>"	N:N
all the while, each one thought most of himself, or of what the money-pig could be thinking. </br>	N:N
it is shorter, the performers are natural, and it has passed away the interval before tea-time. </br>	N:N
which was ridiculous of nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to old brown. </br>	N:N
and some fowls came. </br>	N:N
they went there, and the fox slipped round the house, and peeped and sniffed about until he discovered where the dish was, and then drew down six pancakes and carried them to the wolf. </br>	N:N
she pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house. </br>	A:A
and she did not forget the roebuck, but went into the corner where it lay, and stroked its back. </br>	N:N
late in the autumn, when the weather was rough, windy, and wet, and the cold penetrated through the thickest clothing, especially at sea, a wretched boat went out to sea with only two men on board, or, more correctly, a man and a half, for it was the skipper and his boy. </br>	N:N
they never serve me so. </br>	D:N
who are you? said lucie. </br>	N:N
the bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then he alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang: </br>	N:H
there were rocking chairs, silken sofas, large tables, covered with pictures, books, and playthings, worth a great deal of money,- at least, the children said so. </br>	N:N
when the bear saw that, he was seized with a desire to have some nuts too. </br>	H:Sa
goodbye, hans. </br>	N:N
hereupon he was much troubled, and asked the old fisherman if that was true? </br>	Sa:Sa
the ground is frozen, and besides the snow has covered everything. </br>	N:N
instead of returning to the king, however, he conducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth iron hans. </br>	H:N
in the meantime it struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in darkness. </br>	H:N
the snores continued. </br>	N:N
the other criminals seized him, wrestled with him, and bent him double, so that his head rested between his knees, and they tied him, so that the blood almost came out of his eyes and out of all his pores. </br>	N:N
take back your horse and your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again. </br>	N:N
we reached our old home; but the cottage was in ruins, and we had to build a new one. </br>	N:N
so he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was dangerously ill, and near his death. </br>	F:N
i suppose he is under the ground now; and ida- alas! alas! it is not ended yet; miserable that i am! </br>	Sa:Sa
she put it outside the back-door, and sat down again by the fire, and shut her eyes; when ribby arrived with the doctor, she seemed fast asleep. </br>	N:N
mr. drake puddle-duck advanced in a slow sideways manner and picked up the various articles. </br>	N:N
and the wedding was held, and the merry bells run. </br>	N:H
the ant-king had come in the night with thousands and thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry picked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks. </br>	N:H
he was puzzled. </br>	Su-:F
the bad rabbit would like some carrot. </br>	N:N
however, he got safely in his trunk to the land of turkey. </br>	N:N
after a while he found another rose, which became his home, for among its delicate fragrant leaves he could dwell in safety. </br>	N:N
it was as great and magnificent as it had always been, and the garden looked the same as ever; all the servants were strangers to her, not one of them knew anne lisbeth, nor of what consequence she had once been there; but she felt sure the countess would soon let them know it, and her darling boy, too: how she longed to see him! </br>	N:H
and now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. </br>	Sa:H
they tipped over the jar, and she scrambled out. </br>	N:N
"so she took her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried out, ""there, frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as carefully as you please."" </br>"	N:H
but even in this sleep came a dream or something like it. </br>	N:N
"but the new-comers seemed determined to stay where they were, for they found it very agreeable living ""in a dry place,"" as they called the wet stones. </br>"	N:N
"the little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug place to finish his night""s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning to sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and mother. </br>"	N:N
"it is right so, it is best, said the tree, ""no fetters hold me now. </br>"	H:N
"the day was so warm and beautiful that one might well have said: ""god's kindness to us men is beyond all limits."" </br>"	N:N
"when anything had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal place, he answered: ""oh, no father, i""ll not go there, it makes me shudder!"" for he was afraid. </br>"	F:F
into this she crept when night came, and here she slept. </br>	N:N
"the evening bell is ringing, people used to say; ""the sun is setting!"" </br>"	N:N
just then it came into his mind that he would stoop under the table, and so creep to the door. </br>	N:N
"don't you see that they are feathers, such as i wear and you will wear too?
18:18	n:n	n:n	but ours are finer.
19:19	n:n	n:n	still, i should like to have them up in the nest, for they keep one warm.
20:20	n:su-	n:-	i am very curious to know what the ducks were so startled about; not about us, certainly, although i did say 'peep' to you pretty loudly.
21:21	d:n	d:n	the thick-headed roses ought to know why, but they know nothing at all; they only look at themselves and smell.
22:22	d:d	d:d	i am heartily tired of such neighbours. </br>"	D:N
decidedly there were lively doings in mr. tod's kitchen! </br>	N:N
"if you can perform such deeds as that, you are no gardeners boy; tell me, who is your father?"" </br>"	Su+:N
good evening, growled she, and pretended to be quite friendly. </br>	N:A
"i must die, and part with the warm sunshine, the fresh green meadows, and all the beauty that god has created."" </br>"	Sa:N
"on the ninth day she thought, ""forward! onward!"" </br>"	N:N
oh, there's not much fear of that, he replied; still he put a large stone into the bag, and then tied it tightly, and gave it a push. </br>	N:N
can your name be rumpelstiltskin? said the lady slyly. </br>	H:H
"my dead cousin was here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down below, but no one told me what it was to shudder."" </br>"	Sa:N
"the lord hath forbidden me to let any one in while he is out."" </br>"	N:N
behind the counter, as a rule, there were no young men. </br>	N:N
the sexton crept out, pushed the empty chest into the water, and went to his house, then he measured out a whole bushel full of gold for little claus, who had already received one from the farmer, so that now he had a barrow full. </br>	N:N
if our mother only knew! </br>	Sa:N
and now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long way, he came to a large city. </br>	N:N
"the virgin mary has forbidden it, and it might easily cause thy unhappiness."" </br>"	D:N
in a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. </br>	N:N
suddenly a voice cried: </br>	N:N
the grasshopper seated himself out in the ditch, and thought and considered how things happened in the world. </br>	N:N
"when he was above, he said to the little man: ""now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before the judge."" </br>"	H:N
that is in return for your services, said the old woman, and she shut the gate. </br>	D:N
then the golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might, it was of no use. </br>	Sa:N
with all my heart, replied the drover, opening the sack, from which sprung little claus as quickly as possible. </br>	H:N
it is my father who calls thee. </br>	N:N
he sat down again and nodded, but he could not get the dream out of his thoughts, and he still had the goloshes on his feet. </br>	N:N
his courage had already grown so great that he obeyed the order. </br>	N:N
the boat was round and green, and very like the other lily-leaves. </br>	N:N
"all the common ducks considered the word ""portulak"" a good joke, for it sounded like portugal. </br>"	N:N
"yes, said the master of the house, ""i believe the stone came from the graveyard of the old church of the convent which was pulled down, and the pulpit, the monuments, and the grave-stones sold. </br>"	N:N
then the two other sisters also ate some of the apple, whereupon all three sank deep down into the earth, where they could hear no cock crow. </br>	Su-:N
rapunzel, rapunzel, let down your hair to me. </br>	N:N
the duckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject, but the hen would not listen to such doubts. </br>	N:N
when he gets home it is suffocated. </br>	Sa:N
"when we have done, we will come back and fetch you away."" </br>"	N:N
then he translated the beetle's name into latin, and said a great deal upon the creature's nature and history. </br>	N:N
he did not know whose closed eyes were there, nor what red lips were fading beneath the earth. </br>	N:N
do you not think that i had better go home before it gets dark? </br>	N:N
the body was dead- the toad was killed! </br>	N:N
a storm approaches without, calling aloud for human lives. </br>	N:N
"how can you say so? said she; ""i am sure you never told me not."" </br>"	Sa:Su-
"at last i snowed them up, and they say snow keeps people warm.
110:110	n:n	n:-	it was good for them, for they had no wood, and the forest, from which they might have obtained it, had been cut down.
111:111	n:n	n:s	the frost was very bitter, and i rushed through loop-holes and passages, over gables and roofs with keen and cutting swiftness.
112:112	n:n	n:s	the three high-born daughters were lying in bed because of the cold, and their father crouching beneath his leather coverlet.
113:113	n:n	s:s	nothing to eat, nothing to burn, no fire on the hearth!
114:114	n:n	s:s	here was a life for high-born people!
115:115	d:n	d:s	'give it up, give it up!'
116:116	d:n	d:s	but my lord daa would not do that.
117:117	n:n	n:n	'after winter, spring will come,' he said, 'after want, good times.
118:118	n:n	n:n	we must not lose patience, we must learn to wait.
119:119	n:n	n:-	now my horses and lands are all mortgaged, it is indeed high time; but gold will come at last- at easter.'
120:120	n:n	n:-	i heard him as he thus spoke; he was looking at a spider's web, and he continued, 'thou cunning little weaver, thou dost teach me perseverance. </br>"	N:N
as usual, when out of humor, he determined to move house. </br>	A:N
on the journey, christina met her father at one of the villages through which they passed, and here he took leave of her. </br>	N:N
the room inside was so dark that at first they could make out nothing; but they could hear a noise--a slow deep regular snoring grunt. </br>	N:N
then the match went out, and there remained nothing but the thick, damp, cold wall before her. </br>	Sa:N
while they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat, paddle pat! and the three puddle-ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step-- pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat! </br>	N:N
they are addressed in the language of their country, and the piano sounds for them with melodies of their native land; and before these have died away, the chord has been struck, the wire of thought that reaches to the land of the sufferers announces that they are rescued. </br>	N:N
when they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands, and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. </br>	N:N
jemima became much alarmed. </br>	F:F
the mother and son were walking in the churchyard when they discovered the old bell, and they stood still to look at it. </br>	N:N
in the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly pearl. </br>	H:H
the toad thought it was a flower which had broken loose that it might look about better in the world, which was quite a natural thing to do. </br>	N:N
he sang while he worked-- </br>	N:N
has the pope a great family? inquired the lady. </br>	N:N
for the heart asks for fragrance, even when it is no longer young; and there is very little of that to be found in the dahlias or the dry chrysanthemums; therefore the butterfly turned to the mint on the ground. </br>	N:N
"so his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with the other took his son out of the horse""s ear, and put him down upon a straw, where he sat as merry as you please. </br>"	N:H
from the organ in the church sounded the music and the words of the beautiful psalms, which were written in the old book under the head of the dead one. </br>	N:N
there was an old mansion surrounded by a marshy ditch with a drawbridge which was but seldom let down:- not all guests are good people. </br>	N:N
"where does he rest now? among the many in the big grave that they have dug for the dead?
87:87	sa:n	s:-	perhaps he's in the water in the marsh!
88:88	sa:n	s:-	nobody knows his grave; no holy words have been read over it! </br>"	N:N
"but the youngest said, ""i don""t know how it is, while you are so happy i feel very uneasy; i am sure some mischance will befall us."" </br>"	F:F
although she could not speak, she was still so beautiful and charming that he began to love her with all his heart, and it was not long before he married her. </br>	H:N
during the whole day he enjoyed himself in the warm sunshine, flew from flower to flower, and danced on the wings of the flying butterflies. </br>	H:N
and when he had finished he looked at the whole figure, and thought of all he had heard and read, and what he had that evening related to his little grandson. </br>	N:N
upon the top of the wall there were again the marks of </br>	N:N
he was rather upon his dignity; but he accepted. </br>	N:H
when the cathedral clock struck twelve there was an answer--like an echo of the chimes--and simpkin heard it, and came out of the tailor's door, and wandered about in the snow. </br>	N:N
a honeysuckle hung forth from the hedge, in full bloom; but there were so many girls like her, with long faces and sallow complexions. </br>	N:N
"and as the wind knocked the hanged men against each other, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself: ""if you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and suffer!"" </br>"	Sa:N
and on that very account they thought he must be something. </br>	N:N
they did not look ill at all now, but jumped about and were very merry, yet none of them noticed little ida. </br>	H:H
the roses are good for nothing but to be looked at and to be smelt, or at most to be stuck in a hat. </br>	D:N
he pulled up his shoes, for they were down at the heels, and he was very quick about it. </br>	N:N
"am i not just as good as that great creature yonder, who is waited upon and brushed, and has food and drink placed before him?
14:14	n:n	n:n	and don't i belong to the royal stables? </br>"	N:N
"what are they doing?
77:77	n:n	n:n	what will happen next? thought the fir. </br>"	N:N
now it chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl stopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out of her hand and fell into the well. </br>	N:N
"the little louse has burnt herself, the little flea is weeping,
34:34	su-:n	-:n	the little door is creaking, the little broom is sweeping,

36:36	su-:n	-:n	the little tree is shaking itself. </br>"	Su-:N
he knows not what i call poverty. </br>	N:N
early next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he was gone the children were still in bed. </br>	N:N
i quacked and clucked, but all to no purpose. </br>	N:N
"these are far better than pebbles! said hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and gretel said: ""i, too, will take something home with me,"" and filled her pinafore full. </br>"	Su+:H
he seemed to have put down the sack every dozen yards, to rest. </br>	N:N
hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road. </br>	N:N
i should long ago have had no chairs, benches, seats, nay, not even an oven-fork, but should have thrown everything down at the sinners. </br>	N:N
then he flew down into the grass, turned his head about in every direction, and tapped his beak on the bending blades of grass, which, in proportion to his size, seemed to him as long as the palm-leaves in northern africa. </br>	N:N
so he sat down, and the fox began to run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair whistled in the wind. </br>	N:N
"she ran down, set a jug, said: ""god bless it for you, gretel,"" and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught. </br>"	H:H
the little bird was quite taken aback, for he meant it kindly. </br>	Su-:A
"he's charming, they said to each other, and began a conversation with him in whispers, using the most aristocratic chinese dialect: ""we are of the same race as yourself,"" they said. </br>"	H:N
"then at last he was angry, and cried quite impatiently, ""i wish your neck was broken!"" </br>"	A:A
as he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he involuntarily put it in the water. </br>	Sa:N
but the little peasant stood at his door, and waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. </br>	F:N
he could no longer see the betrothed couple, nor the cheerful old people; but for a long time he could hear them rejoicing and singing. </br>	H:H
the horse-hair was drawn tightly round her leg- as tightly as if the latter were to be cut off; she was in great pain and terror. </br>	F:F
the fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went close to the edge of the waves, and said: </br>	F:Sa
i will teach you to fly, and when you have learnt, we will fly into the meadows, and pay a visit to the frogs, who will bow themselves to us in the water, and cry 'croak, croak,' and then we shall eat them up; that will be fun. </br>	N:N
"they might catch cold,"" said the conscientious jemima. </br>"	N:N
then he raised the head of the sick woman, and smoothed her pillow. </br>	N:N
no, said the king. </br>	N:N
there were once five-and-twenty tin soldiers, who were all brothers, for they had been made out of the same old tin spoon. </br>	N:N
this is a man with a gun. </br>	N:N
"she was scarcely half as long as a thumb, and they gave her the name of ""thumbelina,"" or tiny, because she was so small. </br>"	N:N
she lived in a bank under a hedge. </br>	N:N
"then she saw the boy, and cried to him: ""boy, bring me a wreath of flowers."" </br>"	Su+:N
yes; as you see, i can even venture under the rays of the lamp, in front of the picture of the madonna, but i may not enter the church; still from without, and while you are upon my back, i may look in through the open door. </br>	Sa:N
help! help! exclaimed the young ladies, but there was no danger, for they quickly extinguished the fire. </br>	Su-:Su-
yes, was the answer. </br>	N:N
towards evening he was awakened by a pull at his sleeve; he started up, and the same old citizen stood before him. </br>	N:N
"this is the last straw, said pickles, ""let us close the shop."" </br>"	A:Sa
"march!
68:68	n:n	n:n	forward!
69:69	n:n	n:n	march! </br>"	N:N
of all the boys in the street who sang the mocking song about the storks, not one was so determined to go on with it as he who first began it. </br>	N:N
but the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved, and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that came to the door. </br>	A:A
the cries and screams of the savage horde and of the birds sounded through the air, and i joined in it also; for i sang 'ding-dong! ding-dong!' </br>	Sa:F
how little she thought that this was the very same bottle which her friend had thrown aloft in her honor, on that happy day of rejoicing, in the green wood, in her youthful days. </br>	N:N
all night long they walked, and it was morning before they reached the mill. </br>	N:N
"she drew nearer, she stopped to look at the hat; ""ha! what was lying yonder?"" </br>"	N:N
"no, answered the man, ""i will neither eat not drink."" </br>"	D:N
goodbye, gretel. </br>	N:N
so she took another hearty drink, and let the second chicken follow the first. </br>	N:N
she was not allowed to go out into the warm sunshine. </br>	N:N
what have you brought home? she asked. when she saw the boy. </br>	N:N
i never had that fortune, but he's my pupil, and he does not forget his old master. </br>	N:N
oh! that it were always spring in the fragrant beechwood! </br>	H:N
"it is my husband!"" she quickly hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow, the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet on the porch. </br>"	Su-:N
"so he said, ""do bear it, and i will wish for all the riches on earth for thee, only stay where thou art."" </br>"	N:N
"but do not lose the last penny of the fourpence, simpkin, or i am undone and worn to a thread-paper, for i have no more twist."" </br>"	N:Sa
"this all comes of my fiery temper.

alexander's nose lengthened visibly, he had lost it. </br>	F:N
he sat in a dry rolled-up linden-leaf, which had fallen from the tree on to the wicked man's head, as he was digging the grave. </br>	N:N
he walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a delightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself, as he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on the lovely scenes around him. </br>	N:N
pigling helped himself to meal without scruple. </br>	N:N
and she made haste to light the whole bundle of matches, for she wished to keep her grandmother there. </br>	N:N
but the music-master praised the bird in the highest degree, and even asserted that it was better than a real nightingale, not only in its dress and the beautiful diamonds, but also in its musical power. </br>	H:N
"then the sister cried, ""pray, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a wild beast, and tear me to pieces."" </br>"	F:N
there was a bite almost directly; the float gave a tremendous bobbit! </br>	N:N
"how fares my child, how fares my roe?

mr. mcgregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of peter; but peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him. </br>	N:N

great claus got so frightened that he rushed out of the surgery, jumped into the cart, whipped up his horses, and drove home quickly. </br>	F:F

the cook got up early, before daybreak, to feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away a large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast asleep. </br>	N:Su-

the church stands firm, but the storm careers on over field and moorland, over land and sea. </br>	N:N
while she was doing this kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down the hill. </br>	N:N
"i could not speak; but he seized her hand and said, ""our brother yonder loves you, and is he not dear to you? </br>"	N:N
"if it belonged to me alone, said the man, ""you should have it."" </br>"	N:N
it was difficult to advance: wood lilies and anemones grew almost too high; flowering convolvuli and brambles were hanging like garlands from tree to tree; while the nightingales were singing and the sunbeams played. </br>	N:N
pig-wig looked anxious. </br>	F:F
when it came to jan. 1st there was still no money, and pickles was unable to buy a dog license. </br>	N:N
no, no, thou art not my son; and thou canst not plough go away! </br>	D:N
"i will also give thee this nut,"" continued the night-wind. </br>"	N:N
she let the hair down. </br>	N:N
after a time they heard a noise in the shop, as if something had been pushed in at the door. </br>	N:N
the green leaf floated away on the brook, and the butterfly flew with it, for he was fastened to it, and could not get away. </br>	N:N
the large one belonged to a rich man, and the small one to a poor man. </br>	N:N
the illumination extended even to the most retired of the garden walks, at least not so retired that any one need lose himself there. </br>	N:N
the books travelled all over the world, and some of them came into the hands of the emperor; and he sat in his golden chair, and, as he read, he nodded his approval every moment, for it pleased him to find such a beautiful description of his city, his palace, and his gardens. </br>	H:H
"ah! said the man, dolefully, ""my wife wants to live in a stone castle."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
there was once a merchant who was so rich that he could have paved the whole street with gold, and would even then have had enough for a small alley. </br>	N:N
this was just what tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a great shout, making all the noise he could. </br>	H:H
"ah! well, said she, ""when one goes another may as well follow."" </br>"	D:Su-
but the arrow did the bird no harm; only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away. </br>	N:Su-
holy and wonderful in its might is the white rose of grief, but it is not the one we seek. </br>	N:N
i have no occasion to do so, replied the buckwheat. </br>	A:N
then he too turned aside and rode on the left side of it. </br>	N:N
then the door was opened for him, and he jumped in, and rested himself the whole night through upon his soft bed. </br>	N:N
but she forgot about that hole in the duster; and when she untied it-- there was no mouse! </br>	Su-:Su-
"and once when the angels had all gone out, she thought, ""now i am quite alone, and i could peep in. </br>"	N:N

"yes, answered he, ""that indeed you can. </br>"	H:N
"the lion said: ""they have been informed that they were going to be put to the test, and have assumed some strength. </br>"	A:N
then the king again journeyed forth, and the queen had a little girl, whom also the false sisters threw into the water. </br>	N:N
she gave herself up to her grief, and it tossed her to and fro, as the sea tosses a ship without compass or rudder. </br>	Sa:N
and the chamberlains walked with still greater dignity, as if they carried the train which did not exist. </br>	N:N
"i suppose that is 'the beautiful.'
179:179	n:n	n:n	peep!
180:180	n:n	n:n	but here it is larger than a peacock. </br>"	H:N
yes; but i am made of mahogany, said the top. </br>	N:N
then he saw very well that he had come to the house of a witch, but as it was dark, and he could not go farther, and also was not afraid, he entered. </br>	N:N
the donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in the yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all rather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep. </br>	N:N
you really do need something to give you a little warmth, and yet spiteful people cry out about the few drops you take. </br>	N:N
besides that, the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. </br>	N:Sa
"i wriggled myself free from the fowl.
103:103	n:n	n:n	you are very disagreeable to look at.

107:107	n:n	n:n	but i must go higher up. </br>"	N:N
we shall see, said the old man. </br>	A:N
they had been told by their grandmothers that who ever did so would be sure to have new clothes before the end of the year. </br>	N:N
esteem no man happy until he is in his grave, were the words of solon. </br>	N:N
if i have only a piece of bread (and i certainly shall always be able to get that), i can, whenever i like, eat my butter and cheese with it; and when i am thirsty i can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what can i wish for more? </br>	H:H
"yes, father, answered he; ""i have travelled all over the world, i think, in one way or other, since we parted; and now i am very glad to come home and get fresh air again."" </br>"	H:H
"then the witch was very angry, and said, ""such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful thing, and i must and will have it."" </br>"	A:A
she had committed no crime against the law of the land; she was an honorable person, in a good position- that she knew. </br>	N:N
"but the little invisible beings said, ""the song is never ended; the most beautiful is yet to come."" </br>"	N:N
will the naughty boys freeze and fall in pieces? asked the young storks. </br>	N:N
they placed themselves by the ear of the sleeper, told him dreadful dreams and then flew across his lips, and pricked his tongue with their poisoned spears. </br>	N:N
and at last the man yielded with a heavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever should meet him first on his return. </br>	Sa:Sa
"hold fast, said the animal; ""hold fast, for i am going up stairs."" </br>"	N:N
"what can we do, but lie here and starve?"" </br>"	N:N
no, answered the cat. </br>	N:N
she could now sing at her leisure: </br>	N:N
he seemed to have no objection to stings. </br>	N:N
they led her into the middle of the room, where the moon shone, and danced with her, while all the other flowers formed a circle round them. </br>	N:N
then came the swineherd; he was collecting thistles and shrubs to burn them for the ashes. </br>	N:N
so the tailor once more gave him a pebble, and the bear tried and tried to bite into it with all the strength of his body. </br>	N:N
at about two miles from our cottage, where the earth on the hill is sheltered by a few scattered trees, stood the little church, with a silver lamp hanging before the altar. </br>	N:N
it had something of the taste of seawater, certainly, although it had been drawn from the well outside. </br>	N:N
"but she knew not what answer to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought: ""i will go home and ask if it be i, or if it be not i, they will be sure to know."" </br>"	F:N
they began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. </br>	N:Sa
the little one, with its bright eyes and golden hair, had been welcomed joyously on that dark november day. </br>	N:H
within there were songs and dancing; king waldemar and the young gayly-dressed ladies of the court were dancing together. </br>	H:N
"when he was standing down below at the bottom, they rolled down the largest mill-stone and thought they had broken his skull, but he cried, ""chase away those hens from the well, they are scratching in the sand up there, and throwing the grains into my eyes, so that i can""t see."" </br>"	A:N
if they would only come in here, she thought; but they did not come, and the music continued to play so beautifully, and was so pretty, that she could resist no longer. </br>	N:N
"they were signed, ""faithful till death;"" but at the end of that time, one day the boatman came over to see ib, with a kind greeting from christina. </br>"	N:N
is it jemmy? </br>	N:N
at length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called hans; but he stipulated that clever elsie should be really smart. </br>	N:N
"ib helped her up, and said, ""never mind; follow me. </br>"	N:N
there was a cracking and crushing heard in the tree. </br>	N:N
"then said a straw, ""i will lay myself across, and you may pass over upon me."" </br>"	N:N
have you the cheek to ask how i am getting on? </br>	D:A
far in the interior of the wood, where a noisy swarm of laborers were working, stood waldemar daa and his three daughters, and all were laughing at the wild cries of the birds, excepting one, the youngest, anna dorothea, who felt grieved to the heart; and when they made preparations to fell a tree that was almost dead, and on whose naked branches the black stork had built her nest, she saw the poor little things stretching out their necks, and she begged for mercy for them, with the tears in her eyes. </br>	Sa:Sa
"the wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to the house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into the pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart""s content. </br>"	N:H
in reality the bird was the willow-wren. </br>	N:N
"i know we can see this little white house from the hills across the river.
156:156	n:n	n:n	which way are _you_ going, mr. pig? </br>"	N:N
they poked under the beds with ribby's umbrella and they rummaged in cupboards. </br>	N:N
"i will be king."" </br>"	N:N
you shall likewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited chestnut-horse. </br>	H:N
every-day stories? asked the bachelor. </br>	Su-:N
just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was come, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dininghall. </br>	N:A
oh, take me with you, cried christina; and she sprang after him. </br>	F:N
"fetch the broom and sweep the chamber."" </br>"	A:N
"ah! said the fisherman, ""my wife wants to be pope."" </br>"	N:N
i shall never learn it here as long as i live. </br>	Sa:N
the king heard all this, and when he had come back from the chase, he caused the three girls to be brought to him, and asked them what they had said yesterday on the mountain. </br>	N:N
and she was so pitiless that she took poor rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery. </br>	A:Sa
i'm the father of my daughter! </br>	N:N
yes, do so, said they; and they laughed, and rode on. </br>	H:D
"i will come very punctually, my dear ribby, wrote duchess; and then at the end she added--""i hope it isn't mouse?"" </br>"	N:N
oh no, no, said the young stork, jumping out on the roof with the others; and now they were all attentive, and by the third day could fly a little. </br>	F:F
first they smeared him with butter, and then they rolled him in the dough. </br>	N:N
father, and mother, and brothers, and sisters, were gone to the play; only little anna and her grandpapa were left at home. </br>	N:N
thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land: but over the hills, in the greenwood shade, where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made, there snowdrop is hiding her head; and she is lovelier far, o queen! than thee. </br>	A:N
so the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which tom lay, was thrown out upon a dunghill. </br>	N:N
she sat down before the fire to wait for the little dog. </br>	N:N
when the dreadful storm had passed, the flowers and the corn raised their drooping heads in the pure still air, refreshed by the rain, but the buckwheat lay like a weed in the field, burnt to blackness by the lightning. </br>	Sa:N
he felt himself melting away, but he still remained firm with his gun on his shoulder. </br>	N:N
"the boy ran thither and said: ""give me my ball out."" </br>"	A:N
then a number of tiny beings, as many in number as the flowers on the flax had been, and invisible to mortal eyes, floated above them. </br>	N:N
it would have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook. </br>	Su+:N
at this the girl and her sweetheart roland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole night until daybreak. </br>	F:N
dance you shall, from door to door, and where proud and wicked children live you shall knock, so that they may hear you and fear you! </br>	D:N
the cat family had quite recovered. </br>	N:H
what sort of a duck are you? they all said, coming round him. </br>	N:N
those deep-blue eyes, which had been lit up this evening in honor of him, must conceal treasures, treasures of heart and mind, richer than all the glories of rome; and so when he left the party that night, he had lost it completely to the young lady. </br>	N:H
i have really overtaken more than one hare, when i have been seated on the engine in front of a railway train. </br>	N:N
oh, how nicely it is made, exclaimed the ladies. </br>	H:N
i am here, and here i shall stick. </br>	N:N
when he had finished his supper the man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of stromberg. </br>	N:N
i'll be a soldier, said peter; for he was still quite a little lad, and it seemed to him the finest thing in the world to carry a gun, and to be able to march one, two- one, two, and to wear a uniform and a sword. </br>	N:N
"in the neighbour's yard.
35:35	n:n	n:n	i have as good as seen it myself.
36:36	d:n	d:n	it is almost unbecoming to tell the story, but there is no doubt about it. </br>"	N:N
"at this he grew angry, and said: ""if you will not take care, i cannot help you, i will not be burnt with you,"" and he hung them up again each in his turn. </br>"	A:A
"why are you angry with me? replied the little singing-bird, ""what have i done?"" </br>"	Sa:F
he had just come from the field, he said, and had been put into a card house three stories high, and all made of picture cards with the figures turned inwards. </br>	N:N
"what art thou doing on the tree?"" </br>"	N:N
when it came to her turn to sing, she stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she could not refuse. </br>	Sa:N
"then the youth went next morning to the king, and said: ""if it be allowed, i will willingly watch three nights in the haunted castle."" </br>"	H:N
"alas! said the huntsman; ""the king has ordered me to shoot you."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
she came at last to the door of a field-mouse, who had a little den under the corn-stubble. </br>	N:N
tweet, tweet, sounded over her head suddenly. </br>	Su+:N
"i should like to see beautiful switzerland, to travel through italy, and,""- it was well for him that the goloshes acted immediately, otherwise he might have been carried too far for himself as well as for us. </br>"	N:N
a medicine was offered to him, which he was obliged to take: a bitter remedy, at which the sick body and the oppressed spirit alike shuddered. </br>	N:N
but the ninth time it rose in the air, it remained away, and did not return. </br>	Su-:N
"after a while the cook said to him: ""it is not well for you to be so alone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion."" </br>"	N:Sa
full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him the promised reward. </br>	H:H
soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main. </br>	Su+:Su-
so the duckling sat in a corner, feeling very low spirited, till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door, and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water, that he could not help telling the hen. </br>	Sa:Sa
and all this about the two children was mirrored to old anthony in a single tear, which could soon be wiped away and disappear, but might come again from its source in the heart of the old man. </br>	Sa:N
anthony went to bremen, and there he learnt what poverty and hard living really were. </br>	N:N
i dare say from many i should hear the words, 'please to walk in.' </br>	N:N
"nothing at all, answered their mother; ""that's only something external. </br>"	D:N
"what would i give to have such a prize!"" </br>"	H:Sa
"lend me your goloshes, said he; ""it is so wet in the garden, but the sun is shining brightly. </br>"	N:N
"one summer""s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the window; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. </br>"	H:N
"what coarse work! said the darning-needle, ""i shall never get through. </br>"	Su-:A
twelve of these thou mayest open, and behold the glory which is within them, but the thirteenth, to which this little key belongs, is forbidden thee. </br>	N:N
the king, however, went so frequently away to his dear children that the queen observed his absence; she was curious and wanted to know what he did when he was quite alone in the forest. </br>	N:N
the sleep of death was ended, and the recovered man raised himself. </br>	N:N
do you remember this? </br>	N:N
death continued to stare at the emperor with his cold, hollow eyes, and the room was fearfully still. </br>	N:N
stork, stork, fly away. </br>	N:N
"goody tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the thatch--""the nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter."" </br>"	N:N
the first leisure moment during the next day, the boy got a pencil, and on the back of one of the other drawings he attempted to copy the drawing of the metal pig, and he succeeded. </br>	H:N
"oh, i will eat first."" </br>"	N:N
the youth, however, ate the whole of it himself, and asked if she had nothing more to set before him. </br>	N:N
mr. mcgregor looked down after emptying his sack. </br>	N:N
he told of the salmon that leaps in the rushing waters, while the water-god plays on his golden harp. </br>	N:N
the youth was taken thither, and stayed a year with this master likewise. </br>	N:N
then he looked for the house, but it was not in existence. </br>	N:N
"snowdrop did not dream of any mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that snowdrop""s breath was stopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. </br>"	Su-:N
the walls were resplendent with paintings; here stood statues and busts, all in a clear light as if it were day. </br>	N:N
there was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run alone. </br>	N:N
but at midnight, when all slept, the nurse, who was sitting in the nursery by the cradle, and who was the only person awake, saw the door open and the true queen walk in. </br>	N:N
they went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood. </br>	N:N
the bottle was old, and the glass too. </br>	N:N
when he went in, an old woman was sitting by the fire quite alone. </br>	N:N
suddenly he paused. </br>	N:N
"our lord then inquired if he had no wine, and he said, ""alack, sir, the casks are all empty!"" </br>"	Sa:Sa
"it is well for me that i am dreaming, he thought; ""otherwise i should become really angry. </br>"	N:N
the old bell was, after a time, carried away to a greater distance than any one, even the warder in the bell tower, ever imagined; and the bell in the breast of the young man was heard in countries where his feet had never wandered. </br>	N:N
you seem to know a great deal about natural history. </br>	N:N
"now, said the father to the eldest son, ""take away the eggs without letting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know anything of what you are doing."" </br>"	N:N
the provision basket lay in the lap of the young girl as the family drove out to the forest, and the neck of the bottle peeped out from between the folds of the white napkin. </br>	N:N
when the youth gave it to him, the elf let it fall as before, and asked him to be so good as to give him that piece again. </br>	N:N
here are fifty talers for you. </br>	N:N
likewise in the castle lay great treasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would then be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. </br>	N:N
"there come the drops, said the mother; ""they are trickling down the stalks. </br>"	H:N
as for farmer potatoes, he has been driven nearly distracted. </br>	A:A
"ugh! sighed the daisy, ""that is terrible; now they are done for."" </br>"	Su-:Su-
"you speak without knowing the facts, replied the beetle; ""don't you see that i am a prisoner?"" </br>"	D:A
the duckling remembered the lovely birds, and felt more strangely unhappy than ever. </br>	Sa:Sa
she had just finished. </br>	N:N
and she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood and water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the ashes, and do all the dirty work. </br>	N:N
"it is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is ""soporific."" </br>"	N:N
mr. bouncer would not confess that he had admitted anybody into the rabbit hole. </br>	N:F
then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf. </br>	N:Su+
i bring nothing, but would have something given. </br>	Sa:N
"that depends upon wind and weather, said the elf king; ""they travel economically. </br>"	N:N
"ashputtel""s two sisters were asked to come; so they called her up, and said, ""now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king""s feast."" </br>"	N:N
how full of meaning that glance had been, as she leaned over him, holding in hers the pale hand which he had no longer strength to raise! </br>	N:N
"presently the king""s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him. </br>"	N:Su+
"not all can be born cucumbers; there must be other things, too.
6:6	n:n	n:n	the hens, the ducks, and all the animals in the next yard are creatures too.
7:7	h:n	n:n	now i have a great opinion of the yard cock on the plank; he is certainly of much more importance than the weather-cock who is placed so high and can't even creak, much less crow.

"our dear son has engaged himself, said one mother, ""dear innocent boy; his greatest ambition is that he may one day creep into a clergyman's ear. </br>"	H:N
no one had noticed her when she flew out at the open window, back to her own green woods. </br>	N:N
the one who stood first in the rank was named the thumb, he was short and thick, and had only one joint in his back, and could therefore make but one bow; but he said that if he were cut off from a man's hand, that man would be unfit for a soldier. </br>	N:N
i wish i could console the poor lark, thought the daisy. </br>	N:N
he pushed the hamper into a corner, threw a sack over it to keep the hens quiet, put a pot on the fire, and unlaced his boots. </br>	N:N
at last the emperor wished to see it himself, while it was still on the loom. </br>	N:N
and what stories grandpapa could tell! </br>	H:N
verily, that is the way of the world. </br>	N:N
yet he who wrote all this has looked at me, as every word flowed from his pen upon my surface. </br>	N:N
but that is superbe, said the princess passing by. </br>	H:N
first, i killed all my horses, and then my old grandmother, and it is all your fault; but you shall not make a fool of me any more. </br>	A:N
"by this there will be always 'something' to make me remembered, and is not that worth living for?"" </br>"	N:N
and the black forest snails actually spat at the flower. </br>	D:N
but how light the room was! </br>	Su-:N
it would have been all over with the poor girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard everything. </br>	F:N
if he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden. </br>	A:N
a monument was also erected over his grave. </br>	N:N
much has been said and much written which we pass over or know nothing of. </br>	N:N
"but it's all over now.

she sat there for five hours. </br>	N:N
as he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread, and sewed her together. </br>	H:N
mr. jeremy shoved the boat out again a little way, and dropped in the bait. </br>	N:N
oh, how dreadfully lonely he must have been, said she. </br>	Sa:N
people should see that they were busy to finish the emperor's new suit. </br>	N:N
the book-case and the bird-cage were rescued from under the coal- box--but hunca munca has got the cradle, and some of lucinda's clothes. </br>	N:N
the man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of rapunzel, and took it away with her. </br>	F:N
and what news did giuseppe bring back? </br>	N:N
the boy searched everywhere for it, but he searched in vain, for it could not be found; it was gone. </br>	Sa:N
he thought of the blazing furnace in the factory, where he had been blown into life; he remembered how hot it felt when he was placed in the heated oven, the home from which he sprang, and that he had a strong inclination to leap out again directly; but after a while it became cooler, and he found himself very comfortable. </br>	N:N
he picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he had seen and heard. </br>	Sa:Sa
during the next year, two letters passed between ib and christina. </br>	N:N
even the elder-tree bent down its bows into the water before him, and the sun shone warm and bright. </br>	N:N
he went to put away the mowing machine. </br>	N:N
day after day, and week after week, till the plant became quite a tree. </br>	N:N
"the plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful star-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave his master, he gave him a glass, and said, ""with this you can see all that is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from you."" </br>"	H:H
"yes, give me an apple."" </br>"	N:N
and at last he did so, and in a moment the fox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the princess, who had been lost a great many many years. </br>	H:Su+

"now this king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller""s boast his greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before him. </br>"	Su+:N
the night passed, and the whole of the following day; but no one sent for the goloshes. </br>	N:N
unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them. </br>	N:N
tom kitten took another big jump off the bar and landed on a ledge high up inside the chimney, knocking down some soot into the fender. </br>	N:N
"i have allowed myself to be taken in, said our beetle to himself, ""and now there's nothing to be done but to take them in, in return."" </br>"	N:N
"no, those are frogs, said the little maiden; ""but i think we shall soon hear her now:"" and presently the nightingale began to sing. </br>"	N:N
but the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts. </br>	N:N
"good evening, hans.
45:45	n:f	n:f	where have you been? </br>"	N:N
rouge-pots, scent-boxes, and old cards, so large and so richly gilded, that none are ever seen like them in these days. </br>	N:N
"to 2 1/2 oz. conversation sweeties at three farthings--""what's this? this ain't a license?"" </br>"	Su-:N
your health, and god bless you, was her salutation to him. </br>	H:N
"yes, said the other, ""mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand into his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that beautiful goose?"" </br>"	H:H
"the wind will blow through the frock, and the thorns will tear it off my body."" </br>"	Su-:N
"the father answered: ""your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone, you do not understand anything about it."" </br>"	F:N
the little daisy would have liked so much to help it, but what could be done? </br>	N:N
"he will kiss every one in the room, great and small; yes, even the poor children who stand in the passage, or out in the street singing a carol about the 'star of bethlehem.'"" </br>"	N:N
tom kitten was getting very frightened! </br>	F:F
"and i, poor fellow, said the drover, ""i who am so old already, cannot get there."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
suddenly the door of the room flew open and the draught of air caught up the little dancer, she fluttered like a sylph right into the stove by the side of the tin soldier, and was instantly in flames and was gone. </br>	N:N
"no, answered he, ""how should i know? </br>"	A:N
the sun shone warm and bright, and he found out that it was a very good place. </br>	H:N
when he reached home, the two other apprentices were there again as well, and each of them certainly had brought a horse with him, but one of them was a blind one, and the other lame. </br>	N:N
"don't be angry, said the little bird; ""the 'tweet' slipped out of my beak unawares."" </br>"	Sa:F
years had gone by when, one evening, aphtanides came in. </br>	N:N
"we will place her on one of the water-lily leaves out in the stream; it will be like an island to her, she is so light and small, and then she cannot escape; and, while she is away, we will make haste and prepare the state-room under the marsh, in which you are to live when you are married."" </br>"	N:N
hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children. </br>	N:N
just at this moment the elfin hill opened, and an old elfin maiden, hollow behind, came tripping out; she was the old elf king's housekeeper, and a distant relative of the family; therefore she wore an amber heart on the middle of her forehead. </br>	N:N
it was stern, yet awakened confidence, and the eyes beamed with youthful radiance. </br>	N:N
"poor old bachelor, cut your wood, such a nightcap was never seen; who would think it was ever clean?
15:15	n:n	n:d	go to sleep, it will do you good. </br>"	N:N
night fell, and nothing was left for him to do, but to seek a bed in this painful solitude. </br>	Sa:Sa
"alas, dear father, she answered, ""they have gone away and left me alone!"" and she told him that she had seen from her little window how her brothers had flown away over the forest in the shape of swans, and she showed him the feathers, which they had let fall in the courtyard, and which she had picked up. </br>"	Sa:N
"the little mice also kept away after this, and the tree sighed, and said, ""it was very pleasant when the merry little mice sat round me and listened while i talked. </br>"	N:N
then the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down, over thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside down, and lay on him like a mountain. </br>	Su-:N
driven by fear and horror, she flew homeward; she was almost sinking fainting to the earth, while the flock of pursuing birds increased, some even attempting to peck at her. </br>	F:F
he said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his woodshed. </br>	N:H
"there is one among the fowls who has so far forgotten what is becoming to a hen that she plucks out all her feathers and lets the cock see it."" </br>"	D:N
"we must think of something else, said the king; ""keep your shoes on when you go to bed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide one of them there, i will soon contrive to find it."" </br>"	F:N
but what absorbed mr. tod's attention was a noise, a deep slow regular snoring grunting noise, coming from his own bed. </br>	N:N
what splendid stories you can relate, said the little mice. </br>	H:N
never were seen such ruffles, or such embroidered cuffs and lappets! </br>	N:N
again the day of battle dawned; the sun had not yet risen, but it was morning. </br>	N:N
for behind the wooden wainscots of all the old houses in gloucester, there are little mouse staircases and secret trap-doors; and the mice run from house to house through those long, narrow passages. </br>	N:N
but for each guest the neatest and pleasantest arrangement had been made. </br>	N:N
each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dockleaf, fastened with a pine-needle- pin. </br>	N:N
"perhaps they thought, ""how long will that heap of rubbish remain here to be a disgrace to the whole street. </br>"	N:N
you know, this plant has no blossom; but it is sweetness all over,- full of fragrance from head to foot, with the scent of a flower in every leaf. </br>	H:N
brilliant lamps hung in festoons from tree to tree; and paper lanterns, through which the light shone till they looked like transparent tulips. </br>	N:N
"then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his friendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on and on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey""s end, and found everything to be as the dwarf had told him. </br>"	H:N
"you bad boy! how did you entice her out?
155:155	f:n	f:a	poor little delicate thing, with those rough policemen! and she'll be frozen with cold. </br>"	A:N
and it is well known that if the yard-cock belonging to this family happened to crow at midnight, they would declare it was morning, although the watchman and all the clocks in the town were proclaiming the hour of twelve at night. </br>	N:N
"the princess heard him snorting and growling; she was terrified, and she cried, ""ah, the bear is behind us and wants to get thee!"" </br>"	F:F
"it rings it out in the vault of heaven, far, far out, forever and ever, till the heaven bells sound ""ding-dong! ding-dong!"" </br>"	N:N
"'pygmalion loved his galatea,' was in the song they sung at my first wedding, said alfred; ""i once fell in love with a beautiful statue, which awoke to life in my arms; but the kindred soul, which is a gift from heaven, the angel who can feel and sympathize with and elevate us, i have not found and won till now. </br>"	H:H
"sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will soon learn how to shudder."" </br>"	N:N
"the river said, ""run first to the bride, and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water."" </br>"	N:N
the boy had taught himself to draw: it was also said that a young artist, now famous, had discovered talent in the child just as he was about to be sent away for having tied up madame's favorite little dog, and using it as a model. </br>	N:N
gladly would she have plucked a flower, but she could not overcome her reluctance to break one off. </br>	N:N
wizz! </br>	N:N
indeed, that was very difficult for such a small flower to find out. </br>	N:N
the king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so the soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him. </br>	Su+:H
so he had put forth a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry her. </br>	N:N
the swords and armor on the old knight's pictures rattled. </br>	N:N
and then, taking hold of the creepers and roots, he climbed up on the wet stones, where water-snakes were wriggling and the toads, as it were, barked at him: he reached the top before the sun, seen from such a height, had quite set. </br>	N:N
had he known that it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before him, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did. </br>	N:N
her wicked brother stopped over her, and laughed hideously, as fiends only can laugh. </br>	H:N
"now she was gentle and strong as a wife can be; and from her lips came the words of faith: ""whatever he doeth is right and best."" </br>"	H:N
"ah, she replied, ""the way is so long, and what shall i do in a strange land where i am unknown?"" </br>"	N:Sa
they had also a language of their own. </br>	N:N
but no; i must be silent- i am poor. </br>	N:N
"i think what you once told me, the finest of all, he replied; ""you told me of a thing that has never been out of my thoughts- of the good old custom of 'the bond of friendship,'- a custom i should like to follow. </br>"	H:N
in what manner did you leave the world? he asked, just for the sake of saying something; for it made him feel very weary to stand there and wait. </br>	A:N
thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. </br>	N:N
in the world it often happens that a beer bottle may contain the most precious wine, and a champagne bottle be filled with blacking, but even in decay it may always be seen whether a man has been well born. </br>	N:N
"ah! unlucky wretch that i am! said she; ""would that i had married king grisly-beard!"" </br>"	A:A
but there were preparations upon the kitchen table which made him shudder. </br>	Su-:F
the sight of this made the tailor so angry that he laid hold of the golden footstool, and threw it down to earth through heaven, at the old thief. </br>	A:A
"however, there are quite enough left; i should very much like to examine these a little nearer, especially the moon, for that could not slip away under one's hands.
197:197	n:n	n:n	the student, for whom my wife washes, says that when we die we shall fly from one star to another.
198:198	n:n	n:n	if that were true, it would be very delightful, but i don't believe it.
199:199	n:n	n:n	i wish i could make a little spring up there now; i would willingly let my body lie here on the steps. </br>"	N:N
then he prowled about in the earth, and thought what a pleasant dream that was about the dying horse, and the golden shoes he had inherited. </br>	N:N
"oh, replied the old man, ""i have pleasant thoughts of all that has passed, recalled by memory; and now you are come to visit me, and that is very pleasant."" </br>"	H:H
it was made of clay in the shape of a pig, and had been bought of the potter. </br>	N:N
so the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged their pardon. </br>	F:F
his rich cousin at thyland is dead, and his widow is to have the rich inheritance. </br>	N:N
it was not very pleasant news, and besides, he had left the tinder-box at the inn. </br>	N:N
whatever object in the room he placed his tongue upon immediately received voice and speech, and was able to express its thoughts and feelings as readily as the lady herself could do. </br>	N:N
"ah, she answered, ""have i not reason to weep? </br>"	Sa:Su-
in the anguish of his heart the king consented, and the old woman led him to her little hut, where her daughter was sitting by the fire. </br>	Sa:N
there was a look of cheerfulness on everything. </br>	N:N
"ah! wretch that i am! sighed she; ""why did i not marry king grisly-beard?"" </br>"	A:A
"hold me tight, she would say to the fingers, when they took her up, ""don't let me fall; if you do i shall never be found again, i am so very fine."" </br>"	N:N
"just think, said he, ""when i asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he actually wanted to learn to shudder."" </br>"	A:Su+
a jolly old sow once lived in a sty, three little piggies had she, &c. </br>	N:N
she folded her hands, and hid her face in the cotton curtains of the bed, and wept. </br>	Sa:Sa
where are they going? asked the fir-tree. </br>	N:N
what the bell tells? </br>	N:N
as she did not seem quite willing, and as they could not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed into a beautiful pink, and took her with him. </br>	N:N
among the latter came an old maid, who seemed to be quite alone in the world. </br>	N:N
"they alighted on the ground and blew at each other, and blew all the feathers off, and their swan""s skins stripped off like a shirt. </br>"	N:N
"the father said: ""if it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,"" and he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven young maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face, figure, and size. </br>"	N:N
but such neighbours as ours! </br>	D:N
he asked her what was the matter; but what she said he could not understand. </br>	N:N
could not all these bricks and pieces be as a wall of stone to prevail for him? </br>	F:N
"it is very likely that this is really the same soldier, said she, and i will take care of him, and always remember what you have told me; but some day you must show me the old man's grave."" </br>"	N:N
so at last he ran away, frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings. </br>	N:N
only tangled grass, and yet she was frightened at it. </br>	F:F
so a year passed, and the emperor, the court, and all the other chinese knew every little turn in the artificial bird's song; and for that same reason it pleased them better. </br>	H:H
cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger. </br>	N:N
she smiled once more, and then people said she was dead. </br>	H:H
the venus mountain stood out gray and bare, overshadowing the valley beneath. </br>	N:N
roasted lambs and birds were brought forth, and strong, sweet wine, of which the turks are forbidden to partake. </br>	N:N
they crept up to the bedroom window. </br>	N:N
"the wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat""s long tail standing straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for sultan to fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped up into a tree. </br>"	F:Su-
now whatever is the meaning of this? </br>	N:N
"i am sure i beg your pardon; i did not know that anybody lived here, said mrs. goody tiptoes; ""but where is chippy hackee? </br>"	N:N
"bird, he said, ""how beautifully you sing!"" </br>"	H:H
"my uncle bouncer has displayed a lamentable want of discretion for his years; said peter reflectively, ""but there are two hopeful circumstances. </br>"	N:Sa
he rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in the sand at his feet. </br>	N:N
"the giant took the trunk on his shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and whistled the song: ""three tailors rode forth from the gate,"" as if carrying the tree were child""s play. </br>"	H:H
"how i left the world? she replied; ""why, i can scarcely tell you. </br>"	Su-:N
the stars twinkled; and the new moon, in the form of a crescent, was surrounded by the shadowy disc of the whole moon, and looked like a gray globe with a golden rim: it was a beautiful sight for those who had good eyes. </br>	H:N
with what splendor he filled that dismal dwelling! </br>	N:N
"the second said, ""i grant that at every word she says, a toad shall spring out of her mouth."" </br>"	D:N
alack, i am undone! said the tailor of gloucester, and went sadly to bed. </br>	Sa:Sa
yes, one far more lovely, said one of the women. </br>	N:N
"this is certainly the wisest plan, said the written paper; ""i really did not think of that. </br>"	N:N
the old councillor, who had received three medals for holding his tongue, declared that the skipjack possessed the gift of prophecy; one could tell by his bones whether there would be a severe winter or a mild one; and that's more than one can always tell from the breastbone of the man who writes the almanac. </br>	N:N
"rejoice in thy youth, said the sunbeam; ""rejoice in thy fresh growth, and the young life that is in thee."" </br>"	N:N
"the little louse has burnt herself, the little flea is weeping,
23:23	su-:n	-:-	the little door is creaking, the little broom is sweeping,
24:24	su-:n	-:-	the little cart is running. </br>"	Su-:N
they dug a little grave in the garden. </br>	N:N
"real life furnishes us with subjects for the most wonderful fairy tales; for otherwise my beautiful elder-bush could not have grown forth out of the teapot."" </br>"	N:N
in the hollow way in the clayey bank, many had scratched their names as a remembrance. </br>	N:N
when the casket is everything, the casket should be strong, or else all is over. </br>	N:N
her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for her. </br>	Sa:Sa
pure white curtains fluttered before the open windows, and beautiful flowers stood in shining, transparent vases; and in one of them, which looked as if it had been cut out of newly fallen snow, the apple-branch was placed, among some fresh, light twigs of beech. </br>	N:N
these window-panes would not thaw, and he could see nothing of the stove, which he pictured to himself, as if it had been a lovely human being. </br>	N:N
the roof sloped nearly to the ground. </br>	N:N
"grandmother, cried the little one, ""o take me with you; i know you will go away when the match burns out; you will vanish like the warm stove, the roast goose, and the large, glorious christmas-tree."" </br>"	Sa:N
"you had better say nothing about this to our father, for he does not believe a word you say; and if you tell tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain: but be quiet, and we will let you off."" </br>"	D:N
then it came into his mind, what an easy life his wife had, for she stayed at home in a cool room and enjoyed herself. </br>	N:H
he was a plump young fellow, clad in summer garments and wearing a straw hat. </br>	N:N
"tweet, tweet! said the little bird, for one of his wings being broken, he found it difficult to shake himself; but he quite understood that the bath was meant kindly, and he said, ""you are very kind-hearted, madam;"" but he did not wish for a second bath. </br>"	H:N
"the little tailor at last lost all patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table, and saying: ""wait, and i will give it to you,"" struck it mercilessly on them. </br>"	A:A
"it will be too damp for you here, said the frogs; ""but you are very welcome! </br>"	H:N
he is very rich and learned, and his house is twenty times larger than mine, said the field-mouse. </br>	N:N
the tree after this grew very rapidly, and molly grew with the tree. </br>	N:N
the two others, who wanted to marry, thus saved their lives by a stroke of luck. </br>	N:N
heaven knows what he said; but we may be allowed to guess at it. </br>	N:N
before us rises a great mound of sand- a mountain we have long seen, and towards which we are wending our way, driving slowly along through the deep sand. </br>	N:N
it is i, said he. </br>	N:N
to gretel, mother. </br>	N:N
no ferry-boat can sail over the bay in such weather as this. </br>	N:N
tiddly, widdly, widdly, mrs. tittlemouse! </br>	N:N
at last he had to stop in his career, and the engine ran over his hind legs, and crushed them; for i set upon it. </br>	N:N
"said lina: ""be a fishpond, and i will be the duck upon it."" </br>"	N:N
this story really consists of two parts. </br>	N:N
it was autumn; the trees dropped their leaves, the earnest and severe pastor sat at the bedside of a dying person. </br>	N:N
"not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the king""s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king mourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever brought her back to him should have her for a wife. </br>"	Su-:Sa
"go home, said the fish; ""she is emperor already."" </br>"	N:N
after some time the king returned to his palace and saw that the prophecy was fulfilled, and the luck-child married to his daughter. </br>	N:N
some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg- cup! </br>	N:N
my sweet, darling mother, she heard the child say. </br>	H:N
the old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and snoring. </br>	N:N
they could not find anything, but once they heard a door bang and somebody scuttered downstairs. </br>	N:N
he searched, and found a large golden armlet of superior workmanship, and it was evident that the plough had disturbed a hun's grave. </br>	Su+:N
the little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose. </br>	N:N
"this linen holds the water together so beautifully, that my hind legs quiver as if i were going to swim."" </br>"	H:N
then he went on and came to a wide river over which he must go. </br>	N:N
so cried both of them. </br>	N:N
there was a tumbledown shed at the back of the house, made of old soap boxes. </br>	N:N
"the french call this flower ""marguerite,"" and they say that the little daisy can prophesy. </br>"	N:N
"no, said the sultan; ""i will be true to my master."" </br>"	A:N
"could we rightly describe this picturesque scene, our readers would exclaim, ""delightful italy!"" </br>"	N:N
i could smell the violets, even while i was placing warm penny pieces against the frozen panes to make peep-holes, and a pretty view it was on which i peeped. </br>	N:N
the girl can only see a small piece of field which is surrounded by a high fence. </br>	Sa:N
so when the three servants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in it. </br>	N:Su-
"sleep was still in his eyes, but yet he crowed out: ""three hens have died of their unfortunate love for a cock. </br>"	F:N
just about this time, my dear sweet boy, who lies sleeping there, was born, and my husband was attacked with a severe lingering illness. </br>	N:N
and then suddenly recurred to him the strange event of the evening before, when his head had been fixed between the iron railings in front of the hospital. </br>	N:N
then cried he: </br>	F:Su-
the little maiden was to be my sister. </br>	N:N
oh, my poor mother! he cried, while the tears rolled down his cheeks. </br>	Sa:Sa
"i proposed that as one of the prizes.
54:54	n:n	n:h	the hare most decidedly must have it; and i, as an active and thoughtful member of the committee, took especial care that the prize should be one of advantage to him; so now he is provided for.
55:55	n:n	n:h	the snail can now sit on the fence, and lick up moss and sunshine.
56:56	n:n	n:h	he has also been appointed one of the first judges of swiftness in racing.
57:57	n:n	n:h	it is worth much to know that one of the numbers is a man of talent in the thing men call a 'committee.'
58:58	n:n	n:h	i must say i expect much in the future; we have already made such a good beginning. </br>"	N:N
"don't come so near me, said the garter; ""i am not accustomed to it."" </br>"	D:N
but, grandmother, what large hands you have! </br>	Su-:N
"just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!"" </br>"	N:F
many a time did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go, but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of jorinda. </br>	Sa:Sa
she took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother had given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool to rest upon when she should be weary. </br>	F:N
the window was too small for mr. mcgregor, and he was tired of running after peter. </br>	N:N
"give me a fine fat goose."" </br>"	H:H
"yes, this is east street; how beautifully bright and gay it looks!
144:144	su-:su-	-:-	it is quite shocking that one glass of punch should have upset me like this. </br>"	H:H
and so it went on for a fort- night; till a big wind blew off the top of the tree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain. </br>	N:N
oh that is lovely! said lucie. </br>	H:H
pluck the flower off said the other boy, and the daisy trembled for fear, for to be pulled off meant death to it; and it wished so much to live, as it was to go with the square of turf into the poor captive lark's cage. </br>	F:F
"thank god, that i stand so near and can at least see all the splendour."" </br>"	H:N
the portuguese had certainly a great flow of language, they said to the little bird. </br>	N:N
"oh yes, she replied; ""let us wait a little longer, ib. </br>"	H:N
here is a foreign hothouse plant, too tender for the gardens of the north. </br>	N:N
she also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender). </br>	N:N
the good advice was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where to put it. </br>	N:N
dear me, what pretty dancing-shoes! said the soldier. </br>	Su+:N
then he went into the third room, and there the dog was really hideous; his eyes were, truly, as big as towers, and they turned round and round in his head like wheels. </br>	N:N
when the lord and master came back again with his heavenly companions, he did not see the tailor behind the door, but when he seated himself on his chair the footstool was missing. </br>	N:N
in a house, with a large courtyard, in a provincial town, at that time of the year in which people say the evenings are growing longer, a family circle were gathered together at their old home. </br>	N:N
days and years went by. </br>	N:N
now will i pronounce thy sentence. </br>	N:A
"the inscription ""institution for superior education"" was found near the billiard club, which place of resort was further adorned with the words, ""children brought up by hand."" </br>"	N:N
hauschen, means a little house; and for many years it consisted only of a few small houses, which were scarcely larger than the wooden booths we see in the market-places at fair time. </br>	N:N
the sexton therefore took him into his house, and he had to ring the church bell. </br>	N:N
by day he and all his court were lions, but in the evening they took their right forms again. </br>	N:N
a carriage had to come from the herning hotel to the next village, and she had taken the opportunity to see her friends once more. </br>	N:N
"what a wonderful quantity of plants, cried the beetle; ""how good they will taste when they are decayed! </br>"	H:H
"mew! scratch! scratch! scuffled simpkin on the window-sill; while the little mice inside sprang to their feet, and all began to shout all at once in little twittering voices: ""no more twist! </br>"	N:A
and the tin soldier felt as if he was recovering from a fainting fit. </br>	H:N
he climbed up, and up, and up. </br>	N:N

at the window of one of them sat a little boy with fresh rosy cheeks, and clear sparkling eyes, who was very fond of the old house, in sunshine or in moonlight. </br>	N:H
you have already rewarded me, said the nightingale. </br>	H:N
will you dance with me? said the rough doll. </br>	H:N
"let it go farther!"" </br>"	N:N
alfred, the sculptor, saw this. </br>	N:N
"oh, to travel, to travel! cried he; ""there is no greater happiness in the world: it is the height of my ambition. </br>"	H:N
the bird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time, and meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child. </br>	N:Sa
nor was it long before the little man reappeared. </br>	N:N
"and as she sung, the shadows grew paler and paler; the blood in the emperor's veins flowed more rapidly, and gave life to his weak limbs; and even death himself listened, and said, ""go on, little nightingale, go on."" </br>"	N:N
then he took up his bow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree. </br>	N:N
the king was at first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish. </br>	N:A
and so they made themselves comfortable; but the poor duckling, who had crept out of his shell last of all, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and made fun of, not only by the ducks, but by all the poultry. </br>	N:N
they stirred a little in their sleep, but still they did not wake up. </br>	N:N
"i must wait and see."" </br>"	N:N
and when chippy hackee got home, he found he had caught a cold in his head; and he was more uncomfortable still. </br>	Sa:Sa
they drank their coffee and had a chat together, and then anne lisbeth went away towards the little town where she was to meet the carrier, who was to drive her back to her own home. </br>	N:N
"i wonder why grandmother looks at the withered flower in the old book that way?
6:6	n:n	n:n	do you know? </br>"	N:N
"how fares my child, how fares my roe?
84:84	n:n	n:n	twice shall i come, then never more. </br>"	N:N
"i believe i am crazy already; oh, i wish i were free, then all these sensations would pass off."" </br>"	Su-:N
"hear the story of the year: ""the night of the snow-storm, the heavy dream of the winter night, all shall be dissolved, all shall rise again in the beauteous notes of the bird of popular song, who never dies!"" </br>"	N:N
"the eight little pigs had very fine appetites--""yus, yus, yus! they eat and indeed they do eat!"" said aunt pettitoes, looking at her family with pride. </br>"	H:H
ida kissed her flowers and then laid them, with the box, in the earth. </br>	H:N
what is that noise about? said the old woman, looking round the room, but her sight was not very good; therefore, when she saw the duckling she thought it must be a fat duck, that had strayed from home. </br>	N:N
"poor, despised herbs, said the apple-branch; ""there is really a difference between them and such as i am. </br>"	D:N
the value of the gold he had found was paid to him; it was a large sum- six hundred dollars. </br>	N:N
no; their sighs and lamentations still sounded from above; and she had nearly forgotten them, for the sake of him who was dead. </br>	N:Sa
"then they laughed and said, ""indeed, stupid hans, where wilt thou get a horse?"" </br>"	D:D
the little sister, however, was dreadfully frightened when she saw that her fawn was hurt. </br>	F:F
not wretch enough yet! said the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. </br>	A:A
the little flopsy bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun. </br>	H:H
they stopped and stood in a row and stared up at the kittens. </br>	N:N
the window stood open the whole day, and the little elf could easily have reached the roses, or any of the flowers; but he could not find it in his heart to leave one so afflicted. </br>	N:N
"that would indeed be the most dreadful thing that could happen to me."" </br>"	Su-:F
"whenever a good child dies, an angel of god comes down from heaven, takes the dead child in his arms, spreads out his great white wings, and flies with him over all the places which the child had loved during his life.
1:1	h:n	s:n	then he gathers a large handful of flowers, which he carries up to the almighty, that they may bloom more brightly in heaven than they do on earth.
2:2	h:n	h:h	and the almighty presses the flowers to his heart, but he kisses the flower that pleases him best, and it receives a voice, and is able to join the song of the chorus of bliss. </br>"	Sa:N
and the jasmine opened its large white bells, and spread forth its sweet fragrance; it had no other way of showing its grief for the dead. </br>	N:Sa
she let it be made known also that whosoever solved her riddle should marry her, let him be who he might. </br>	N:N
his own history was changed into that of anthony till it became quite a story, and many stories might be made by others, so we will leave them to relate their own. </br>	N:N
then they flew within the four naked walls of the miser. </br>	N:N
where are the butter and cheese? said he. </br>	N:Su-
the two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their stepmother had said to their father. </br>	N:N
"his children were called ""wellborn,"" and when he died, his widow was treated as a lady of position, and that was ""something."" </br>"	N:N
"some call me little elder-tree mother; others a dryad; but my real name is 'remembrance.'
115:115	n:n	n:n	it is i who sit in the tree which grows and grows.
116:116	n:n	n:n	i can remember things and tell stories!
117:117	n:n	n:n	but let's see if you have still got your flower. </br>"	N:N
"ding-dong! ding-dong"" thus it sounds complainingly out of the bell-deep in the odense-au. </br>"	N:N
they embraced their dear mother, and jumped like a tailor at his wedding. </br>	H:H
and he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end where he stationed himself, and began to wish. </br>	N:N
then he went out and sent away the company, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back to the kingdom. </br>	N:N
there were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and the other poor. </br>	N:N
"and as she kissed him and her children, she said, ""it came from god, through my child in the grave."" </br>"	H:N
she had a little boy who brought a bright red star into the world with him. </br>	N:N
good evening, mother. </br>	N:N
cut open the dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will find a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise. </br>	H:N
"little molly and anthony often stood by this mountain, and one day molly said, ""do you dare to knock and say, 'lady halle, lady halle, open the door: tannhauser is here!'"" </br>"	N:N
"let's be off to the beautiful farm!"" </br>"	N:N
sorrow and suffering deprived anthony's father of his strength, so that he had something else to think of besides nursing his love-sorrows and his anger against molly. </br>	Sa:Sa
yes, and a fine noise you make, thought the audience, as the play went on. </br>	H:N
the flame was as a star on his breast, and added another heart to the danish arms. </br>	N:N
so they were drowned, repeated anne lisbeth; but she said no more, and the subject was dropped. </br>	N:N
this last delicacy played a principal part in the salad. </br>	N:N
and nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman. </br>	N:N
heaven aid me now! said she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her, and found that within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. </br>	F:Su+
at last she overtook frederick, who desired her to give him something to eat. </br>	N:N
the dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. </br>	H:H
"you may smoke three, answered the king, ""but do not imagine that i will spare your life."" </br>"	A:N
she still remembered what in her childhood's days her mother had looked upon as the greatest among the beautiful. </br>	N:N
the moon shone down upon the grave, but the dead was not there; every child could go safely, even at night, and pluck a rose from the tree by the churchyard wall. </br>	N:N
the saddle hurt his back, and he had not yet any idea what to wish for. </br>	N:N
pigling ate the peel, and washed up the porridge plates in the bucket. </br>	N:N
the sixth comes before the seventh, said the elf king, for he could reckon; but the sixth would not come forward. </br>	N:N
the men stared at him. </br>	N:N
"then the huntsman said, ""give the old one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was the servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give the youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and no stripes"": for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten. </br>"	A:N
thank goodness, here comes one of my own class, with whom i can talk, said the ball, examining the gilded top. </br>	Su+:N
"so he walked for a short time by the side of little red-cap, and then he said: ""see, little red-cap, how pretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? </br>"	N:N
as the evening came on, the devil returned home. </br>	N:N
and so, on every summer day the dance was repeated, the same questions asked, and the same answers given. </br>	N:N
he had been placed in a row, with a whole regiment of his brothers and sisters all brought out of the same furnace; some of them had certainly been blown into champagne bottles, and others into beer bottles, which made a little difference between them. </br>	N:N
after doing this, he hurled it high into the air. </br>	N:N
not wretch enough yet! said the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him too. </br>	A:A
will you go with us, and become a bird of passage? </br>	N:N
three young huntsmen also went out, and when they had travelled about for eight days, they arrived at a great castle, in which were beautiful apartments, and in one room a table was laid on which were delicate dishes which were still so warm that they were smoking, but in the whole of the castle no human being was either to be seen or heard. </br>	N:N
they delivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were condemned to death for their wicked deeds. </br>	N:N
then they all hid under a bush and watched for mr. mcgregor. </br>	F:N
presently she passed the laborer's hut; his wife stood at the door, and the two women spoke to each other. </br>	N:N
"the sister said, ""oh, i pray you, dear brother, do not drink, or you will become a roebuck, and run away from me."" </br>"	F:N
he was quite dry himself and grinning; and he threw the cup of scalding tea all over mr. tod. </br>	H:H
our earth hung over his head like a great dark red ball. </br>	N:N
"on hearing this, the man said, ""i will give you something in exchange for those three things; not money, for that i have not got, but something that is of far more value. </br>"	Su+:N
we will not do thee any harm. </br>	N:N
"so she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when the moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, ""thou shinest through the night, over field and grove--hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?"" </br>"	Sa:N
thus each mother spoke of her baby, and their babies talked after their own fashion, and made use of the little nippers they have in their tails to nip the beard of the beetle. </br>	N:N
so he went back and fetched the tinderbox, and then the witch drew him up out of the tree, and he stood again in the high road, with his pockets, his knapsack, his cap, and his boots full of gold. </br>	N:N
does the gentleman wish to be ferried over the holm? asked one. </br>	N:N
and they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated themselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the red sea. </br>	N:N
"there are ten neckerchiefs in it, she replied, ""as well as beautiful dresses, stockings, and a hat and veil."" </br>"	Su+:N
as they pressed her further with questions she threw her golden necklace down to them, and thought to content them thus. </br>	N:N
he went to the tower in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for a ladder which would reach up to the very top. </br>	N:N
there was a rush upon the opening day. </br>	N:N
in fact some people wish they had gone further. </br>	N:N
there lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange. </br>	N:N
it was just three hundred and sixty-five years old, but that long time was to the tree as the same number of days might be to us; we wake by day and sleep by night, and then we have our dreams. </br>	N:N
ah, that was when i was a little boy. </br>	N:N
the moment he had gone, tommy brock got up in a hurry; he rolled mr. tod's dressing-gown into a bundle, put it into the bed beneath the pail of water instead of himself, and left the room also-- grinning immensely. </br>	H:H
the stickleback floundered about the boat, pricking and snapping until he was quite out of breath. </br>	F:A
then the noble lady drove by towards the baron's mansion with her three daughters, in a gilded carriage drawn by six horses. </br>	N:N
the hamper containing six fowls and a young pig was no light weight; it was taken down hill, unsteadily, with jerks. </br>	N:N
"he answered: ""i sold my cow""s skin in the town, for three hundred talers."" </br>"	N:N
i bring nothing, i want something given me. </br>	Sa:N
but the bell got neither rest nor sleep. </br>	Sa:N
when his time was up, he packed up his knapsack, and went on his travels, singing the journeyman's song,- </br>	N:N
it was good fun, and they sang over the dead ashes,- </br>	N:N
"if thats the case,"" said the bear, ""i should very much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither."" </br>"	N:N
"the little bird hopped round it and sang, ""how beautifully soft the grass is, and what a lovely little flower with its golden heart and silver dress is growing here."" </br>"	H:H
they wandered across an open field to a mud hut, which they rented for a dollar and a half a year, a new home, with bare walls and empty cupboards. </br>	N:N
we were set free about easter-time. </br>	N:N
i should never have thought so, and nobody must know it! </br>	F:N
his horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. </br>	N:H
"i wonder what those two chinese are whispering about, whispered one duck to another; ""they are always doing it, and it annoys me. </br>"	N:A
then they took off their coats, and lay down on the table to sleep; for they made themselves quite at home. </br>	N:N
they were flowers once. </br>	N:N
well, next time you go into his garden, you must tell one of the flowers that there is going to be a grand ball at the castle, then that flower will tell all the others, and they will fly away to the castle as soon as possible. </br>	N:N
a number of people, consisting of seamen, copenhagen citizens, and a few scholars, sat in deep conversation over their mugs, and took very little notice of the new comer. </br>	N:N
"in the public roads one is always safe."" </br>"	N:N
then the huntsman did as the old woman told him, cut open the bird, took out the heart, and carried the cloak home with him. </br>	N:N
"it is a good thing against sea-sickness to have a steel stomach, and not to forget one's own importance.
59:59	n:n	n:-	now my sea-sickness has past: delicate people can bear a great deal. </br>"	N:N
she certainly might have asked more sensible questions; but if she had not been allowed to say just what she liked, would her daughter have been there, leaning so gracefully on her shoulder, and looking straight before her, with a smile that was almost mournful on her face? </br>	N:N
so he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife ilsabill sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. </br>	N:N
i should like to see him now, while i am so merry. </br>	H:H
"peter rabbit, peter rabbit!"" shouted benjamin bunny. </br>"	Su+:N
it was yet spring, some were sitting on their eggs, others had already hatched their young broods; but how they fluttered about and cried out when the axe sounded through the forest, blow upon blow! </br>	N:N
"yes, every night he comes and tortures me!
63:63	n:n	a:n	in my violence i have done this and that.
64:64	n:n	n:n	i was born with an evil mind, which has brought me hither for the second time; but if i have done wrong i suffer punishment for it.
65:65	n:n	n:n	one thing, however, i have not yet confessed.
66:66	n:n	n:n	when i came out a little while ago, and passed by the yard of my former master, evil thoughts rose within me when i remembered this and that.
67:67	n:n	n:-	i struck a match a little bit on the wall; probably it came a little too close to the thatched roof.
68:68	n:n	n:-	all burnt down- a great heat rose, such as sometimes overcomes me.
69:69	sa:n	s:s	i myself helped to rescue cattle and things, nothing alive burnt, except a flight of pigeons, which flew into the fire, and the yard dog, of which i had not thought; one could hear him howl out of the fire, and this howling i still hear when i wish to sleep; and when i have fallen asleep, the great rough dog comes and places himself upon me, and howls, presses, and tortures me.
70:70	n:n	s:n	now listen to what i tell you!
71:71	a:n	a:n	you can snore; you are snoring the whole night, and i hardly a quarter of an hour! </br>"	A:N
"the sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called out, ""stop! stop! </br>"	F:Su-
his rod was a tough stalk of grass, his line was a fine long white horse-hair, and he tied a little wriggling worm at the end. </br>	N:N
i have lost my rod and basket; but it does not much matter, for i am sure i should never have dared to go fishing again! </br>	Su-:F

once when it so happened that no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he kept his little cap on. </br>	F:N
for very joy, it felt ready to jump out of people's hands, and scarcely noticed that its cork had been drawn, and its contents emptied out, till it found itself carried to a cellar, to be left there and forgotten. </br>	H:H
i got out of bed, and reached the window; i could not crawl any farther from weakness and exhaustion; but i managed to open the window. </br>	N:N
the stepdaughter once had a pretty apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and told her mother that she must and would have that apron. </br>	A:A
the youngest, who was in the clock-case, was the only one he did not find. </br>	N:N
winter is its time for rest; its night after the long day of spring, summer, and autumn. </br>	N:N
far in the interior of the country lay an old baronial hall, and in it lived an old proprietor, who had two sons, which two young men thought themselves too clever by half. </br>	N:N
soon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. </br>	N:N
the kitchen was empty and silent; the clock had run down. </br>	N:N
we are in a rich, happy house, where the master, the servants, the friends of the family are full of joy and felicity. </br>	N:H
great was old mr. bouncer's relief and flopsy's joy when peter and benjamin arrived in triumph with the young family. </br>	H:H

and while mr. jeremy sat disconsolately on the edge of his boat--sucking his sore fingers and peering down into the water--a much worse thing happened; a really frightful thing it would have been, if mr. jeremy had not been wearing a mackintosh! </br>	Sa:F
"but as the roast meat smelt so good, gretel thought: ""something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!"" </br>"	N:H
she was also a generous-hearted, faithful girl; she showed that thoroughly while kaela lay sick, fading away. </br>	N:N
"no, said he, perceiving her evil intention, ""i will not give you the light until i am standing with both feet upon the ground."" </br>"	F:N

once, however, when the king had gone out, and no one else was present, the wicked woman seized the queen by the head, and her daughter seized her by the feet, and they lifted her out of the bed, and threw her out of the window into the stream which flowed by. </br>	N:N
then the counsellor leaned his head on his hand, drew a deep breath, and pondered over all the strange things that had happened to him. </br>	N:N
the first who wore old anthony's cap felt the truth of this, though it was half a century afterwards. </br>	N:N

their colours and patterns, they said, were not only exceptionally beautiful, but the clothes made of their material possessed the wonderful quality of being invisible to any man who was unfit for his office or unpardonably stupid. </br>	N:N
in the autumn she picked up the fallen nuts and leaves, and carried them into the hole. </br>	N:N
goodbye, hans. </br>	N:N
good day, gretel. </br>	H:N
beautiful flowers, round which little bells were tied, stood in the corridors: what with the running to and fro and the draught, these bells tinkled so loudly that no one could speak to be heard. </br>	N:N
it was now washed and rinsed, which process was really quite necessary, and afterwards it looked clean and transparent, and felt young again in its old age; but the paper which it had carried so faithfully was destroyed in the washing. </br>	N:N

"one winter""s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and as she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the snow. </br>"	N:N
she had a green linen apron thrown over her head and shoulders, and it was quite wet, as if it had been raining heavily. </br>	N:N
and thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but she laughed more than all at a good king who was there. </br>	D:N
"there, i can help you, said dummling, ""just come with me and you shall be satisfied."" </br>"	H:N
soldiers like the knave of clubs, and citizens with waving banners. </br>	N:N
the girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a cage on the wall. </br>	N:N
the next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and turned to run away. </br>	F:F
but she made no answer. </br>	N:N
"there, bird, said the shoemaker, ""now sing me that song again."" </br>"	N:N
the boys still played in the garden, and the youngest wore the golden star on his breast, with which the tree had been adorned during the happiest evening of its existence. </br>	N:N
it immediately took root, sprouted, and sent out shoots among the other plants. </br>	N:N
each wished to keep the best things they had. </br>	N:N
what is it? asked the king. </br>	A:N
he sought them everywhere in the palace and garden, but could not find them. </br>	N:N
not a word spoken in this country could the bottle understand; it was a language it had never before heard, and it is a great loss not to be able to understand a language. </br>	N:N

"after this the miller saw the skin in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: ""what have you there?"" </br>"	Su+:N

lucinda sat upon the upset kitchen stove and stared; and jane leant against the kitchen dresser and smiled--but neither of them made any remark. </br>	N:Sa
the mouse at once asked what name had been given to the third child. </br>	N:N
where do you come from? and what do you know? asked the mice, who were full of curiosity. </br>	N:N
then he said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and wished himself near the town where his father lived. </br>	N:N
he went on at first like a mere automaton, without thought or wish; therefore the goloshes had no opportunity to display their magic power. </br>	N:N
no. </br>	N:N
he was obliged to shut his eyes and pretend to sleep. </br>	N:N
the woman ran away and found her husband, who was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg. </br>	F:Sa

beauty beamed from kaela's every feature, glittered in her eyes, lurked in the corners of her mouth, and pervaded every movement of her agile fingers. </br>	N:N

"here are my five fingers, said the old goblin; ""now tell me a story for each of them."" </br>"	N:N
she pushed poor gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting. </br>	N:F
"go home, said the fish, ""to your pigsty again."" </br>"	N:N
look, yonder is an old wooden shoe sailing along, said one of the younger girls. </br>	N:N
many a time he thought he had found it, but then it seemed to him to be, after all, too little. </br>	N:N
"whilst she fetched it, the king""s son rode away, and the servant who had to buckle his saddle tight, was the only one present when the wicked witch came with the drink. </br>"	N:N
the lamp before the picture of the madonna threw a strong, effective light on the pale, delicate face of the child. </br>	N:N
"when she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to one of her servants, and said, ""take snowdrop away into the wide wood, that i may never see her any more."" </br>"	A:A
"i will not be king."" </br>"	N:N
a poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the fireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. </br>	N:N
he could not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being in his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. </br>	Su+:Su+
the foxy gentleman admired them immensely. </br>	H:H
then the watchman thanked him, and gave him as a reward two asses laden with gold, which followed him. </br>	H:N
he would draw the coverlet closer round him, pull his nightcap over his eyes, and try to turn his thoughts from trade, and from the labors of the day, to olden times. </br>	N:N
and no sooner was hansel there than he sat down to gamble again. </br>	N:N
then he unfolded to them both the beauties of nature, in all her works; he pointed out to them how, in the scale of creation, inanimate matter was inferior to animate nature; the plant above the mineral, the animal above the plant, and man above them all. </br>	N:N
he heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. </br>	Su+:H
there he stood in his room, holding a little piece of pink paper between his fingers, on which was a poem,- a poem written by the lieutenant himself. </br>	N:N
the king could not refuse this request, so the soldier took his tinder-box, and struck fire, once, twice, thrice,- and there in a moment stood all the dogs;- the one with eyes as big as teacups, the one with eyes as large as mill-wheels, and the third, whose eyes were like towers. </br>	N:N
presently he dropped half the onions. </br>	N:N
then they croaked in harsh accents of the forest that now existed no more, of the many pretty birds' nests destroyed and the little ones left without a home; and all for the sake of that great bit of lumber, that proud ship, that never sailed forth. </br>	N:N
there were doors and windows in the house, cut in the body of the queen of hearts. </br>	N:N
when great claus came out of church, he took up the sack, and placed it on his shoulders. </br>	N:N
the bear in great fury ran after the carriage. </br>	A:A
alfred wept, and mamma wept, and they both wore mourning. </br>	Sa:Sa
"you simpleton, said the eldest, ""you are always afraid; have you forgotten how many kings"" sons have already watched in vain? </br>"	D:N
so they gave him a mouthful of food outside, and at night, when they went to rest, the two others would not let him have a bed, and at last he was forced to creep into the goose-house, and lie down on a little hard straw. </br>	N:N
the moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies. </br>	N:N
everybody looked at her feet, and the whole of the way from the church door to the choir it seemed to her as if even the ancient figures on the monuments, in their stiff collars and long black robes, had their eyes fixed on her red shoes. </br>	N:N
"said lina: ""then do you become a church, and i""ll be the chandelier in it."" </br>"	N:N
ib had never been on the heath where christina's father lived, nor on the river; but at last came an opportunity. </br>	N:N
"as soon as she could pick herself up out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the parson, and said, ""sir, sir, the cow is talking!"" </br>"	F:Su-
her head rested on dry land, but her feet were in the water; her wooden shoes, which were only tied on by a wisp of straw, were carried away by the stream, and thus she was found by martha when she came to bring her some coffee. </br>	N:N
the path led to a part of the thicket where the trees had been cleared; there were leafy oak stumps, and a sea of blue hyacinths --but the smell that made benjamin stop was not the smell of flowers! </br>	N:N
"when the giant saw him, he called out, ""it is lucky for that you have come, for i have not had anything to eat for a long time. </br>"	H:H
"the metal pig raised himself gently, and the boy heard him say quite distinctly, ""hold tight, little boy, for i am going to run;"" and away he started for a most wonderful ride. </br>"	Su+:N
she did not know what that was, she thought and thought, but she could not find out, she opened her riddle-books, but it was not in them---in short, her wisdom was at an end. </br>	Su-:N
she made a cup of tea for timmy; but he didn't come and didn't come. </br>	N:N
close by grew a slender, beautiful, rose-bush, but some wicked hand had broken the stem, and the half-opened rosebuds hung faded and withered on the trailing branches. </br>	Sa:N
it really was a very pretty sight. </br>	N:N
then you will come to a great high castle, on the threshold of which you must let the wand fall, and go straight through the castle, and out again on the other side. </br>	N:N
"not in my opinion, said the fourth; ""i will never follow the lead of others, and only imitate what they have done. </br>"	D:N
the chief thing still remains. </br>	N:N
she said that an apple-branch was a most lovely object, and an emblem of spring in its most charming aspect. </br>	H:N
"good woman, said he to her, ""can you not show me the way through the forest?"" </br>"	N:N
"better to crow than to be puffed up and break off!

it rolls and thunders with a sound that penetrates for miles into the land; and we are quite near the roaring. </br>	N:N
good day, gretel. </br>	N:N
"ha! thought she, as she woke up and looked at it through the window, ""after all i cannot prevent the sun rising."" </br>"	N:N
that was ill done, hans, you should have carried the bacon on your head. </br>	A:A
so they sat down, and when dummling pulled out his cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good wine. </br>	Su+:N
is it possible that i am not fit for my office? </br>	F:N
he found himself tucked up in a little moss bed, very much in the dark, feeling sore; it seemed to be under ground. </br>	Su-:Sa
"the king said to his daughter: ""i will proclaim a great feast that shall last for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. </br>"	N:N
"he flew in a mantle of fire, cried another, ""and lovely little cherubs peeped out from the folds."" </br>"	N:N
jemima puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had always been a bad sitter. </br>	N:N
it will make a great mess in my bedroom; but i could never sleep in that bed again without a spring cleaning of some sort, said mr. tod. </br>	N:N
the wood was very thickly grown. </br>	N:N
his father had been dead some time, and his mother kept no farm servants. </br>	N:N
certainly he must long to see me, too, the young count; no doubt he thinks of me and loves me, as in those days when he would fling his angel-arms round my neck, and lisp 'anne liz.' </br>	H:N
and now he had carved holger danske, who stood there erect and proud, with his long beard, holding in one hand his broad battle-axe, while with the other he leaned on the danish arms. </br>	N:N
he had on the goloshes; they had not been sent for, and as the streets were still very dirty, they were of great service to him. </br>	N:N
"nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to oneself, said she, and was quite satisfied with her day""s work. </br>"	H:H
she could hear the sounds of music, but she heard not the words, the word in which she was to trust. </br>	N:N
and when they came to the hazel-tree, the white dove sang: </br>	N:N
on the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in plum-pudding for old brown. </br>	N:N
how beautiful existence is! said each rose. </br>	H:N
pigling bland drew forward a coppy stool, and sat on the edge of it, shyly warming his hands. </br>	N:N
somehow there were very extra-- ordinary noises overhead, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party. </br>	N:D
the wind could have told that his only protector was an artist, who, by reading each leaf to him, made it plain; and that they amused themselves by playing at nine-pins together. </br>	N:N
then he took it into his head to measure how many steps he would have to go through the roads and cross-roads that are on the leaf of a linden-tree. </br>	N:N
i knew him formerly, when we used to drink together to our good fellowship: he came here once to fetch his wife, she is dead now. </br>	N:N
then the two sisters said to each other that they would throw the beautiful boy into the water. </br>	A:N
"then the miser said, ""bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity""s sake."" </br>"	F:F
the rocking-horse spoke of training and races; the wagon of railways and steam power, for these subjects belonged to each of their professions, and it was right they should talk of them. </br>	N:N
"yes, answered he, ""i heard, and will take care to remember."" </br>"	H:N
"the name over the window was ""ginger and pickles."" </br>"	N:N
then the maiden looked at them and recognized her brothers, was glad and crept forth from beneath the bed. </br>	H:H
"what a good thing it is when one has presence of mind!

a goblin lived with the huckster, because at christmas he always had a large dish full of jam, with a great piece of butter in the middle. </br>	N:N
the bunches of blue hyacinths and the little white snowdrops jingled their bell-like flowers, as if they were real bells. </br>	N:N
the little man took him by the hand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget to take the blue light with him. </br>	F:N
ah, yes! where was the furrier's daughter? and where was the land which might lie nearest to her home? </br>	N:N
now we have flowers enough, said the child; but the angel only nodded, he did not fly upward to heaven. </br>	H:N
the youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to do. </br>	N:N
"take these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you come, and who is your father, for i have reason to be ashamed of you."" </br>"	D:Sa
the counsellor now saw quite plainly a lamp, and a large building behind it; everything looked familiar and beautiful. </br>	N:N
the good bachelor appeared very ignorant, for the simplest remark of the counsellor seemed to him either too bold or too fantastic. </br>	N:N
dark mists, more in number than those that cover the northern skies, cloud the human heart. </br>	Sa:N
her eyes were closely shut, but the brightness of her complexion and a ribbon which her breathing moved to and fro, left no doubt that she was alive. </br>	N:N
but on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that ashputtel had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing: </br>	N:N
a great black raven darted down in front of her on the high road, and croaked dismally. </br>	N:N
suddenly there were fearful squeals; alexander had squeezed inside the hoops of the pig trough and stuck. </br>	F:F
mr. piperson fetched meal from a chest and made porridge, it seemed to pigling that something at the further end of the kitchen was taking a suppressed interest in the cooking; but he was too hungry to be troubled by noises. </br>	N:N
once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it fell to the ground and broke. </br>	Sa:N
"who's been digging-up my-nuts?"" </br>"	A:N
"the king came in the morning, and, finding all he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller""s daughter, and she really became queen. </br>"	N:H
presently an old cattle driver, with snowy hair, passed by, carrying a large staff in his hand, with which he drove a large herd of cows and oxen before him. </br>	N:N
"heaven preserve us! he thought, and opened his eyes wide, ""i cannot see anything at all,"" but he did not say so. </br>"	Su-:Su-
it is just the reverse of you,' said the dog; it's as black as a crow, and has a long neck and a brass knob; it eats firewood, so that fire spurts out of its mouth. </br>	N:N
"why, gretel?
34:34	su-:su-	-:-	what do you mean by that? </br>"	Su-:Su-
jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. </br>	H:H
there was once a sculptor, named alfred, who having won the large gold medal and obtained a travelling scholarship, went to italy, and then came back to his native land. </br>	N:N
after a long pause, pigling went on tiptoe and peeped round the door into the front kitchen; there was nobody there. </br>	N:N
gladly and of good courage, the form arose in splendor and in majesty, and vanished like the glancing of the northern light. </br>	N:H
he groped his way carefully for several yards; he was at the back of the skirting board in the attic, where there is a little mark * in the picture. </br>	N:N
"it is really too ridiculous."" </br>"	N:N
those upon the canvas and in the glory over the altar were just as beautiful as the carved ones; and they were painted and gilt into the bargain. </br>	N:N
"nonsense! said the wife; ""he will do it very willingly, i know; go along and try!"" </br>"	A:N
it will not please you more than the others, said the cat. </br>	N:N
"the peasant said: ""they want to make me mayor, if i will but put myself in the barrel, but i will not do it."" </br>"	F:N
but when evening came and she still stayed away, hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she was lying among the corn asleep. </br>	Su+:N
"yes, truly, replied the peasant, ""i sank deep, deep down, until at last i got to the bottom; i pushed the bottom out of the barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number of lambs were feeding, and from thence i brought this flock away with me."" </br>"	H:N
"when one of the chickens was swallowed down, and still her master did not come, gretel looked at the other and said: ""what one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what""s right for the one is right for the other; i think if i were to take another draught it would do me no harm."" </br>"	N:N
"what, the town! he continued, ""the whole world shall hear of it!"" and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb""s tail. </br>"	H:H
"next morning, when the loss was reported abroad, all the people cried loudly, ""the queen is a man-eater. </br>"	N:N
so the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks, but there were no eggs. </br>	N:N
but those are only two characters, said little anna. </br>	N:N
the boy went on his way with his cap in his hand, while the wind fluttered his golden hair till the locks stood up straight. </br>	N:N
"the daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was, but the king did not know, and said: ""he followed the enemy, and i did not see him again."" </br>"	Su+:N
then doctor knowall showed the lord where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man. </br>	H:N
full threepence, replied the countryman. </br>	N:N
but her hair turned as green as duckweed, and was always having to be colored up. </br>	N:N
as these told their tales, there fluttered around them, with twittering and song, the bird of popular song, who never dies so long as the earth has a hill upon which his foot may rest. </br>	N:N
it doesn't do that with a good will, thought the fowl, and lifted up her head to peck at the caterpillar. </br>	D:N
"i am contented with anything, replied the husband, ""so far as i am concerned, bread and cheese will do,"" and looked at the peasant and said: ""come and eat some more with me."" </br>"	H:N
they had plucked out all their feathers. </br>	Su-:N
and yet all this while the tree grew a notch or joint taller every year; for by the number of joints in the stem of a fir-tree we can discover its age. </br>	N:N
she had delicate hands, beautifully white, and her neck was whiter still. </br>	N:N
so the father harnessed eight horses, and brought one which was so long and thick, that the eight horses could only just carry it. </br>	N:N
"yet will i be compassionate, and take you in, if you will do what i wish."" </br>"	N:N
duchess in the meantime, had slipped out at the back door. </br>	N:N
"let me see him, said the young man, and then he smiled and shook his head, and said, ""it can scarcely be the same, but it reminds me of something that happened to one of my tin soldiers when i was a little boy."" </br>"	H:H
how beautiful they were! and the shoemaker said that they had been made for a count's daughter, but that they had not fitted her. </br>	N:N
then they pulled the horses out of the stable and rode off in rain and wind to obtain the assistance of friends. </br>	H:N
then he looked up and the last one had left off work. </br>	Su+:N
the hounds were running off, flocks of wild fowl flew screaming over the barrows, while the bramble bushes twined round the old stones. </br>	N:N
"yes, you may sing very well, you have all your limbs uninjured; you should feel what it is like to lose your body, and only have a neck and a mouth left, with a cork stuck in it, as i have: you wouldn't sing then, i know.
6:6	n:n	n:s	after all, it is just as well that there are some who can be happy.
7:7	sa:n	s:s	i have no reason to sing, nor could i sing now if i were ever so happy; but when i was a whole bottle, and they rubbed me with a cork, didn't i sing then?
8:8	n:n	n:s	i used to be called a complete lark.
9:9	n:n	n:s	i remember when i went out to a picnic with the furrier's family, on the day his daughter was betrothed,- it seems as if it only happened yesterday.
10:10	n:n	n:s	i have gone through a great deal in my time, when i come to recollect: i have been in the fire and in the water, i have been deep in the earth, and have mounted higher in the air than most other people, and now i am swinging here, outside a bird-cage, in the air and the sunshine.

in the face of anne lisbeth, lighted up by the evening sun, could be seen peace and rest. </br>	H:N
yes, it is a delightful place; there is nothing to do all day long but eat, and while we are so well off out there, in this country there will not be a single green leaf on the trees, and the weather will be so cold that the clouds will freeze, and fall on the earth in little white rags. </br>	N:N
little fat pig- wig's petticoats fluttered, and her feet went pitter, patter, pitter, as she bounded and jumped. </br>	F:N
it is impossible, my dear duchess; there was not a patty-pan. </br>	N:N
"now, thought the fir, ""all my splendor is going to begin again."" </br>"	H:N
however, he went with her into the cow-house, to try and see what was the matter. </br>	N:N
i am quite sure if i recollect all this tomorrow, it will appear utterly ridiculous and absurd. </br>	N:N
may heaven pity us. </br>	Sa:N
but the stream rushed on stronger and stronger. </br>	N:N
and then ashputtel took the dishes to her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball. </br>	H:H
i should very much like to know how they are getting on with the cloth, thought the emperor. </br>	N:H
he had not flown far, however, when he came across a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate booty, and so seized and swallowed him. </br>	F:N
and when she really had the little child in her arms, and held it up to its father, then it was like one of the angels in the church to behold, with hair like gold- the gleam of the setting sun was upon it. </br>	N:N
this was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as lightning. </br>	N:N
"alas! he said, ""what will become of me?"" </br>"	F:Sa
kikkeriki, in the lofty hall!' </br>	N:N
meantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his last penny in his joy at getting the cow. </br>	N:N
she was very appreciative, and incredibly ignorant- a kind of female gaspar hauser. </br>	N:N
then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and night, till he came again to the castle. </br>	F:N
the old goblin from norway, who lives in the ancient dovre mountains, and who possesses many castles built of rock and freestone, besides a gold mine, which is better than all, so it is thought, is coming with his two sons, who are both seeking a wife. </br>	N:N
"one indeed came who set thee free, and he is now near thee again; but how have you used him?

gretel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them. </br>	Su+:H
i set it on my head and it kicked my face. </br>	A:N
then a little bird in the thicket sang out clearly, and old anthony thought of the minstrel's song. </br>	N:N
"it will be best to conceal it."" </br>"	N:N
"what a good thing that i have not got it!
136:136	n:n	h:n	i might have been in a very disagreeable position. </br>"	H:N

whither? </br>	N:N
there was one, but it lay in the coffin of the dead; no one knew anything about it. </br>	N:N
early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds. </br>	N:N
when the two heard that, they were frightened to death, and ran away in great haste. </br>	F:F
"why not? asked the king""s son. </br>"	N:N
one day it rained very fast. </br>	N:N
its head was covered by the wet blanket, and it was not snoring any longer. </br>	N:N
a change had, however, taken place in his wife; after she had been restored to life, it seemed as if all love for her husband had gone out of her heart. </br>	N:N
then at last the other flowers interceded for him, especially those who had lain in the doll's bed, and the carnival rod gave up his dancing. </br>	N:N
"at the end of this time, he came home again, and his father asked: ""now, my son, what have you learnt?"" </br>"	N:N
"do you think that farther out in the wood there may be others of our race?"" </br>"	N:N
it must really have been a gorgeous sight to behold, in those days, when the shoemaker brought over the shield, when the court-house was changed. </br>	N:N

death is an electric shock which we receive in our hearts, and on the wings of electricity the liberated soul flies away swiftly, the light from the sun travels to our earth ninety-five millions of miles in eight minutes and a few seconds; but on the wings of electricity, the mind requires only a second to accomplish the same distance. </br>	N:N
he wanted his supper of little fat mouse! </br>	Su-:N
"they even could have afforded to keep two horses, but it was a saying among the farmers in those parts, ""the horse eats himself up;"" that is to say, he eats as much as he earns. </br>"	N:N
the sparrow spread out her wings once more, then drew them closely to her, and lay dead near the neighbouring family, the beautiful fresh roses. </br>	Su-:N
he did not take the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased that he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in such a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. </br>	F:N
in half an hour the moon rose over the wood. </br>	N:N
a person could walk up and down for a whole day through the streets, and tire himself out with looking at the pictures; and then he would know all about what people lived in the houses, for they had hung out their shields or signs; and, as grandfather said, it was a very instructive thing, in a great town, to know at once who the inhabitants were. </br>	N:N
he was undecided, and knew not if he were worthy of this, but the doves counselled him to do it, and at length he said yes. </br>	F:N
"he thought to himself, ""if the giant sees me going in, my life will not be worth much."" </br>"	F:F

one morning lucinda and jane had gone out for a drive in the doll's perambulator. </br>	N:N
when therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and cried aloud for joy. </br>	H:H
the girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were all empty, and still she saw no one. </br>	N:N

"your imperial majesty, said he, ""cannot believe everything contained in books; sometimes they are only fiction, or what is called the black art."" </br>"	N:N

yes, she is smiling at the memory of that day, and many thoughts and recollections of the past; but the handsome young man is gone, and the rose has withered in the old book, and grandmother is sitting there, again an old woman, looking down upon the withered rose in the book. </br>	N:N

"so he went out and took the maiden aside, and said: ""tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do not do it, you shall lose your life."" </br>"	A:A
but that was only a taste, i must have more. </br>	N:N
he himself had been wounded, and my mother bound up his arm. </br>	N:N
she heard all this and could say nothing to the contrary, but the king would not believe it, for he loved her so much. </br>	N:N
"and so she sat there in her pride, and had many such thoughts as these,- ""i could almost fancy that i came from a sunbeam, i am so fine. </br>"	H:N
ribby set the pie upon the table; there was a very savoury smell. </br>	N:N
mrs. tittlemouse looked at her severely. </br>	D:A
'o-h, o-h,' she would say, 'no bell sounded at thy burial, waldemar daa. </br>	Sa:N
he wanted to run out, but she held him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. </br>	Su-:N
you can make one up, said the little boy. </br>	N:N
one morning it had quite opened, and its little snow-white petals stood round the yellow centre, like the rays of the sun. </br>	N:N
then a neighbor came in, and she had also a marito under her arm. </br>	N:N
very well, said she; and they set out: and as frederick walked the fastest, he left his wife some way behind. </br>	D:N
"the host who heard this, laughed and said: ""if that is your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here."" </br>"	Su+:N
it appeared to have become lighter, for the old drover was not half so heavy as little claus. </br>	N:N
the landlord was a rich man, and a good man too; but as passionate as if he had been made of pepper and snuff. </br>	N:A
nationality may assert itself until it becomes affectation, and the developments of a century may run wild, as youth often does. </br>	N:N
it was built entirely of porcelain, and very costly, but so delicate and brittle that whoever touched it was obliged to be careful. </br>	N:N
but what are we to do now? said the coal. </br>	F:F
this is passing extraordinary! said the tailor of gloucester, and turned over another tea-cup, which was upside down. </br>	Su-:Su+
i gave a horse for it. </br>	N:N
"the son was in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: ""yes, dear father, your will shall be done,"" and thereupon the king shut his eyes, and died. </br>"	Sa:Sa
so he served the bailiff for a year, and when that was over, and the other servants were getting their wages, he said it was time for him to take his too. </br>	N:N
so the little broom began to sweep frantically. </br>	N:F
quack, quack, cried she, and one after another the little ducklings jumped in. </br>	N:N
now i know what it is to have visits from one's old recollections, and all they bring with them. </br>	N:N
to the rabbits underneath it sounded as if the floor would give way at each crash of falling furniture. </br>	F:N
but especially was she sorry for the beautiful white butterfly which she had fastened to the leaf, for if he could not free himself he would die of hunger. </br>	Sa:Sa
the bear, however, could not rest until he had seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it again. </br>	A:A
he found another mole trap newly set; he was still upon the track of tommy brock. </br>	N:N
he was young at that time- indeed, he is young still, although he is ten years older than he was then. </br>	N:N
"alas! you only remind me of what i have lost."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
"who can the strangers be? asked the lizards; ""what can the matter be? </br>"	N:N
"then he came back, knocked at the door of the house, and called: ""open the door, dear children, your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you."" </br>"	N:N
"i see well enough, said the witch, ""that you can do no more today, but i will keep you yet another night, in payment for which you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small."" </br>"	N:N
all that he asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. </br>	H:N
"why should i have such a precious thing?
21:21	n:n	n:n	and if it makes others angry, it can't give me any pleasure.
22:22	n:n	n:n	no, i only wish i could get to the edge of the well, and look out; it must be beautiful up there. </br>"	N:N
anthony was one of the oldest of the clerks, and just the subject for a painter. </br>	N:N
when dinner-time drew nigh, catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and put it on the fire to fry. </br>	N:N
he was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole, and shut his eyes. </br>	N:N
when the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried: </br>	N:N
then the sunbeam kissed the lowly flower, and he kissed the blooming apple-branch, upon whose leaves appeared a rosy blush. </br>	N:N
"that shall not help you, cried she, ""even if you have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me."" </br>"	A:A
"the young giant went up to him, and said, ""does my father see what a fine man his son has grown into?"" </br>"	N:N
then the fisherman went home, and found ilsabill sitting on a throne that was two miles high. </br>	N:N
"then i will sing, replied pig- wig, ""you will not mind if i say iddy tidditty? </br>"	N:N
humpty dumpty, cried others, and there was a fine shouting and crying out. </br>	N:N
the king was well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn. </br>	H:H
i am willing, said the fox, and showed him the by-paths and ways by which at length they reached the cellar. </br>	N:N
"i will give you a piece of advice.
54:54	n:n	f:n	fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the pocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and leave a track in the streets. </br>"	N:N
she thinks it is a very hard cupboard! </br>	Su-:N
there was no air beside the hot burning sulphur flame, and there was no ground under their feet; they, the wicked ones, sank deeper and deeper, while eternal silence surrounded them! </br>	N:N
a story, a story, cried the children, pulling a little fat man towards the tree. </br>	H:N
she had wished to keep back a soul from its immortal flight; she had forgotten her duties towards the living who were left her. </br>	N:N
then he turned to go home, but when he came to a place where two roads crossed, there was little claus driving the cattle. </br>	N:N
"the following day the old woman said to him, ""what is this? </br>"	N:Su-
the gnats were buzzing about and stinging, while the miserabili, outside, moaned in their dreams. </br>	N:N
of course there are the tradesmen's carts--the butcher, the fishman and timothy baker. </br>	N:N
the world is no good! he said. </br>	A:A
"the old witch is dead!"" </br>"	H:H
hush! said little claus to his sack, at the same time treading upon it again, till it squeaked louder than before. </br>	N:N
the huntsman was about to do so and stooped, on which the mannikin took a stick, seized him by the hair, and gave him a good beating. </br>	Su-:N
and the little girl showed everything to the boy, and the elder-tree continued to breathe forth sweet perfume, while the red flag with the white cross was streaming in the wind; it was the flag under which the old sailor had served. </br>	N:N
and my pie was going to be veal and ham. </br>	N:N
it had struck on a rock, which rose from the depths of the sea, and sank at once, like an old shoe in a puddle. </br>	N:N
"oh, said a young courtier, ""now we have found her; what wonderful power for such a small creature; i have certainly heard it before."" </br>"	N:N
the tailor obeyed, but once when saint peter went outside the door, he got up, and full of curiosity, went round about into every corner of heaven, and inspected the arrangement of every place. </br>	N:N
at the same time, the kind-hearted old man who lived by himself in the upper storey of the house came in; he led a lonely life, for he had no wife and children; but he loved the children of others very much, and he could tell so many fairy tales and stories, that it was a pleasure to hear him. </br>	N:H
"and you will come to me soon, will you not, dear mother?"" </br>"	N:N
only a faint glimmer of light struggled through the horn panes in the little window on the roof, while within sat the old clerk, generally on his bed, singing his evening hymn in a low voice; or he would be moving about in his booth till late in the night, busily employed in many things. </br>	N:N
"happy! exclaimed the fir-tree, and then as he reflected upon what he had been telling them, he said, ""ah, yes! after all those were happy days."" </br>"	H:H
"the others are very pretty children, said the old duck, with the rag on her leg, ""all but that one; i wish his mother could improve him a little."" </br>"	D:N
this is a nice gentle rabbit. </br>	N:N
the duck came to them, and hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him. </br>	N:H
the next heart was a complete cabinet of mirrors, such as can be seen in the castle of rosenberg. </br>	N:N
"she sprang to the door to run away; but on the steps king grisly-beard overtook her, and brought her back and said, ""fear me not! </br>"	F:N
then the daughter gave her some of the water of the fountain to drink, and she became strong and healthy. </br>	Su+:N
karen herself was dressed very neatly and cleanly; she was taught to read and to sew, and people said that she was pretty. </br>	N:N
as soon as the stone was laden, it began to rise up on high with the maiden and the young man, and mounted through the opening of the ceiling into the upper hall, from whence they then could easily reach the open air. </br>	N:N
the tailor put on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he thought his workshop was too small for his valour. </br>	H:N
hans went into the parlour, but the miller said he should not sit down to table, for he was so ragged and torn, that they would all be ashamed of him if any one came in. </br>	D:D
"o man of the sea!
27:27	n:n	n:s	hearken to me!
28:28	n:n	n:s	my wife ilsabill will have her own will, and hath sent me to beg a boon of thee! </br>"	N:N
so was the counterpane. </br>	N:N
a more fantastical imagination than herschel's must have discovered these. </br>	N:N
but the paper did not go on its travels; it was sent to the printer, and all the words written upon it were set up in type, to make a book, or rather, many hundreds of books; for so many more persons could derive pleasure and profit from a printed book, than from the written paper; and if the paper had been sent around the world, it would have been worn out before it had got half through its journey. </br>	N:N
but who should come in but the wolf! </br>	N:Su-
now the drake came up, and he thought the little singing-bird was a sparrow. </br>	N:N
"but the book in which i have read this account, said the emperor, ""was sent to me by the great and mighty emperor of japan, and therefore it cannot contain a falsehood. </br>"	N:N
it seemed as if she would never again know sleep, and yet it would have been her best friend, one who would have strengthened her body and poured peace into her soul. </br>	N:N
the eldest brother, he who fabricated bricks, soon discovered that each brick, when finished, brought him in a small coin, if only a copper one; and many copper pieces, if placed one upon another, can be changed into a shining shilling; and at whatever door a person knocks, who has a number of these in his hands, whether it be the baker's, the butcher's, or the tailor's, the door flies open, and he can get all he wants. </br>	Su+:N
i am feeling very much better, said duchess, waking up with a jump. </br>	N:H
he came round the back of the fir- tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his cousin peter. </br>	N:Su-
as these thoughts passed through her mind, fear gave speed to her feet, so that she walked faster and faster. </br>	F:F
the boy did not know whether he had better jump into the arno, or go home and confess everything. </br>	F:N
here was a large company of rags, the fine ones lying by themselves, separated from the coarser, as it ought to be. </br>	N:N
"i cannot go back.
83:83	f:n	f:n	if i slipped i might fall in the fire and singe my beautiful tail and my little blue jacket. </br>"	F:N
at last the hamper was bumped down upon a kitchen floor, the lid was opened, and pigling was lifted out. </br>	N:N
he lifted her into the carriage, but her feet continued to dance, so that she kicked the good old lady violently. </br>	N:N
"bellissima is gone.
149:149	n:n	f:n	open the door, and then kill me. </br>"	N:N
his mother also told him how the chiming of that old bell had once filled her heart with joy and confidence, and that in the midst of the sweet tones her child had been given to her. </br>	H:H
it creaked; he turned round with a jump. </br>	N:Su-
it had been changed into the purest gold- into gold that constantly grew and expanded into flowers and fruit of immortal beauty. </br>	N:N
they asked hans where his horse was. </br>	N:N
"that is not what i asked, persisted the widow; ""i mean, has he a wife and children?"" </br>"	N:N
and the days went by, in life as in dreams! </br>	N:N
"then he called to the miser, and said, ""tell us now, you vagabond, where you got that gold, or i shall play on for your amusement only,"" ""i stole it,"" said the miser in the presence of all the people; ""i acknowledge that i stole it, and that you earned it fairly."" </br>"	A:A
"the mother said, ""no, my dear little daughter, it is too cold, thou mightest die of cold."" </br>"	N:N
and then the conversation turned on other matters. </br>	N:N
neither the mole nor the field-mouse knew anything about it, for they did not like swallows. </br>	N:N
we spoke of the sorrows of greece, and of the men of the country who could be trusted. </br>	N:N
it was- only think!- it was really the tin soldier, the very same which had been lost up in the old man's room, and had been hidden among old wood and rubbish for a long time, till it sunk into the earth, where it must have been for many years. </br>	Su+:N
she could relate the history. </br>	N:N
let us first see what the other case contains before we are angry, said the emperor; then the nightingale was taken out, and it sang so beautifully that no one could possibly say anything unkind about it. </br>	N:N
at home that evening he spoke of travel in the wide world, and of the golden treasure that lay hidden for him in his violin. </br>	N:N
ribby put the pie into the lower oven; the door was very stiff. </br>	N:N
i am able to affirm with word of oath, that each prize- at least, those for which i voted- was given with just and proper consideration, said the old boundary post in the wood, who was a member of the committee of judges. </br>	N:N
"we all three offered a silent prayer, and then she said to us, ""will you be friends in life and in death?"" </br>"	N:N
"you must not scold him, said the mother-snail; ""he creeps so very carefully. </br>"	N:N
can i by any means get to see her. </br>	N:N
and next morning when the king had his twelve huntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once looked at the spinning-wheels. </br>	N:N
"then the gardener""s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden bird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a wood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his bow and made ready to shoot at it. </br>"	N:N
with that the weather-cock broke off; but he did not kill the yard cock, although the hens said that had been his intention. </br>	F:A
then she pulled the second hair out. </br>	N:N
then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high that the eye could scarcely follow it. </br>	N:N
in a large party it is very disagreeable to find a button giving way, with no studs at hand to fall back upon; but it is worse still in a large company to be conscious that your wife and mother-in-law are talking nonsense, and that you cannot depend upon yourself to produce a little ready wit to carry off the stupidity of the whole affair. </br>	N:N
the sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind the hill: jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old walls of the castle. </br>	Su-:N
away he went, and stayed away all day and all night, and his wife remained behind a forsaken widow. </br>	N:N
"then the king""s youngest child had a great desire for an apple, and said to her sisters, ""our father loves us far too much to wish us underground, it is my belief that he would only do that to people who were strangers."" </br>"	N:N
"but when he came to the words, ""the nightingale is the most beautiful of all,"" he exclaimed, ""what is this? </br>"	Su-:N
he blew the thistle- down all over the room. </br>	N:N
"very well, said she, ""it shall all be ready."" </br>"	N:N
in the time of swords and peri wigs and full-skirted coats with flowered lappets--when gentlemen wore ruffles, and gold-laced waistcoats of paduasoy and taffeta--there lived a tailor in gloucester. </br>	N:N
he felt his face, but it was cold as ice. </br>	D:N
nonsense, replied the field-mouse. </br>	D:N
"and another sang--""little bita bread and-no-cheese! </br>"	A:N
he took it quickly out, but it was already quite gilded. </br>	F:N
in a moment he found himself in switzerland, closely packed with eight others in the diligence. </br>	N:N
oh, no; i cost them something more than you. </br>	N:N
"oh yes, replied the counsellor; ""i am very fond of reading useful old books, and modern ones as well, with the exception of every-day stories, of which we really have more than enough. </br>"	H:N
she was courted and admired by every one; but her master's son, who had been home on a visit, was so much pleased with christina that he wished to marry her. </br>	Su-:H
and the little toad came up and expressed her sympathy. </br>	Sa:N
if the lady and her visitors can laugh at this, surely you can. </br>	N:N
so now this little girl was my sister. </br>	N:N
at this the son was vexed; and forgetting his word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. </br>	A:A
when god is so hard to me, how can i expect men to be better? she said with groans and tears. </br>	Sa:Sa
for shame, it is natural repeated all her ladies. </br>	D:N
he became at last desperate; and when one of them said he was tipsy, he did not doubt the man's word in the least- only begged them to get a droschky; and then they thought he was speaking the muscovite language. </br>	N:N
and she covered him up well, so that he might not take cold. </br>	N:N
"if i had only such a little singing-bird, i'd be kind and good as a mother to him, for it's in my nature, in my portuguese blood."" </br>"	N:N
the old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his white beard hung down. </br>	N:N
"good gracious, what has come over me?
355:355	su-:h	-:n	i never felt before as i do now; it must be the air of spring.
356:356	h:h	h:h	it is overpowering, and yet it is delightful. </br>"	Su-:Su-
"when he learnt the wickedness of his daughter he said, ""i cannot believe that she has behaved so ill, but the truth will soon come to light,"" and bade both go into a secret chamber and keep themselves hidden from every one. </br>"	D:N
"see, said the king, ""if you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us."" </br>"	N:H
but they did not get on well, for the real nightingale sang in its own natural way, but the artificial bird sang only waltzes. </br>	N:Sa
they slept in twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody could find out how it happened, or where they had been. </br>	N:N
the third of the boys was, however, the drudge, who was looked on as foolish by the others; they begrudged the mill to him, and afterwards he would not have it. </br>	N:D
the three little elves peeped out again, but she did not greet them, and without looking round at them and without speaking to them, she went awkwardly into the room, seated herself by the stove, and began to eat her bread-and-butter and cake. </br>	N:N
soon afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always good and kind to all about her. </br>	Sa:Sa
"the witty little duck said of the portuguese, that the old lady was getting quite a ""doting ducky,"" all the other ducks laughed at this. </br>"	N:D
are you really going away so soon? asked the clerk. </br>	N:N
his own image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful swan. </br>	Su+:N
he said there were as many inhabitants in that town as he had nails in his body. </br>	N:N
peter hid his dandelions, and accompanied the afflicted parent, who was all of atwitter. </br>	N:F
but tom kitten has always been afraid of a rat; he never durst face anything that is bigger than-- </br>	F:F
"i should have the birds building their nests on my boughs, and when the wind blew, i should bow with stately dignity like my tall companions."" </br>"	N:N
from the street could be seen the room in which the walls were covered with leather, ragged and torn, and the green in the balcony hung straggling over the beams; they pulled it down quickly, for it looked ready to fall, and at last it was cleared away altogether. </br>	N:N
no one will recognize it; not even the thistle nor the stinging-nettle. </br>	N:N
"and pickles makes a low bow and says, ""with pleasure, madam,"" and it is written down in a book. </br>"	N:N
"no, that is only a cow lowing, said the little girl; ""we are a long way from the place yet."" </br>"	N:N
in a certain mill lived an old miller who had neither wife nor child, and three apprentices served under him. </br>	N:N
i don't think that can be the bell, said one of the confirmed children, and then he lay down and listened. </br>	N:N
there is no end to them! </br>	N:N
the poor woman built herself a little house- it was small and narrow, and the window was quite crooked, the door too low, and the straw roof might have been better thatched. </br>	N:N
as for the puddle-ducks--they went into a pond. </br>	N:N
"i only ask one thing, she replied; ""let no one know that you have a little bird who tells you everything. </br>"	N:N
the other paid him back in the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and belaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on the ground at the same time. </br>	A:N
for a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. </br>	Su-:N
he sang it out clearly, sweetly, richly, in well-sounding verses; while the other investigated created matter itself, and even cut it open where need was. </br>	N:N
"then the wolf was very angry, and called sultan ""an old rogue,"" and swore he would have his revenge. </br>"	A:A
and the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she had worn the day before. </br>	N:N
"there stood the bear, and he called the fox before him and said: ""fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be general and lead us."" </br>"	N:N
"she's thick, and fat and ugly, said the young green frogs; ""and her children will be just as ugly as she is."" </br>"	D:N
"the king was hunting too, and heard that and went thither, and when he met the youth, he said, ""who has given thee leave to hunt here?"" </br>"	N:N
the little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them. </br>	N:N
when the hounds are following me, i can spring into a tree and save myself. </br>	N:N
pig-wig opened her mouth and shut it again; pigling coughed asthmatically. </br>	N:N
so he remained standing a while, and at length inquired if he too could not be a doctor. </br>	N:N
"whats the matter?"" said the miller. </br>"	F:N
her youngest child, looked for in the midst of prosperity, had sunk into the grave when only a few weeks old; and at last christina herself became sick unto death, and lay, forsaken and dying, in a miserable room, amid poverty she might have borne in her younger days, but which was now more painful to her from the luxuries to which she had lately been accustomed. </br>	Sa:Sa
the counsel pleased the king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer him military service when he awoke. </br>	H:H
i made the snowflakes whirl till the snow lay like a great lake round the ship, and drifted over it. </br>	N:N
they leapt nimbly upstairs and downstairs, and were merry and happy. </br>	H:H
then he kissed her lips; and so they parted. </br>	H:N
but often there would arise in his mind a doubt as to whether every coal had been quite put out in the little fire-pan in the shop below. </br>	N:N
now he was fourteen years of age, tall, handsome, and clever. </br>	N:N
i had my own cushion, and there was a stove- it is the finest thing in the world at this season of the year. </br>	N:N
the peasant did not require to be invited twice, but got up and ate. </br>	H:N
put it in my pocket. </br>	N:N
the children, however, saw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling after them. </br>	N:F
"i can't find my way home!"" </br>"	F:F
the pine-forests looked like little groups of moss on high rocks, whose summits were lost in clouds of mist. </br>	N:N
so the cunning thief climbed up the tree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird; and it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its ease. </br>	N:N
"and they drink bucketfuls of milk; i shall have to get another cow!
16:16	n:n	n:n	good little spot shall stay at home to do the housework; but the others must go.
17:17	n:n	n:n	four little boy pigs and four little girl pigs are too many altogether. </br>"	N:N
good heaven! what's the matter with you? asked his mother. </br>	Su-:Su-
after these words he was about to slip into his hut again, but the tailor held him so tightly by the corner of his coat, and pleaded so piteously, that the old man, who was not so ill-natured as he wished to appear, was at last softened, and took him into the hut with him where he gave him something to eat, and then pointed out to him a very good bed in a corner. </br>	N:Sa
upon the roof of the pig-stye sat dr. maggotty and three jackdaws. </br>	N:N
and the town repeated what the fire-drum had said. </br>	N:N
"oer hill and o""er dale so happy i roam, work light and live well, all the world is my home; then who so blythe, so merry as i?"" </br>"	H:H
i cannot draw you a picture of peter and benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made peter rabbit and little benjamin cry. </br>	N:F
bellissima in the watch-house! she cried. </br>	F:N
"and his daughter was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him, ""before i marry anyone i must have three dresses: one must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver, like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this, i want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin."" </br>"	Su-:Su-
"then the other answered, as if very unwillingly, ""a little space i may allow thee to sit here, if thou wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an hour below, till i have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown to me."" </br>"	N:H
"you must go straight on till you come to the castle where the horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it."" </br>"	N:N
the innocent little peasant was unanimously sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel pierced full of holes. </br>	F:N
the other birds, too, now fell upon the sparrow and plucked off feather after feather until she fell bleeding into the rose-bush. </br>	N:N
"the parson ran out as fast as he could, and the miller said: ""it was true; i saw the black rascal with my own eyes."" </br>"	F:Su+
then i bury them, as it were; there they lie, dead and powerless, till they come back new and better characters. </br>	Su-:N
that would be a fine thing! cried the miller, and looked there, and found the cakes. </br>	Su+:Su+
so he shot his arrow at the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and ran into the wood. </br>	N:N
"snowdrop looked out at the window, and said, ""good day, good woman! what have you to sell?"" </br>"	N:N
now this riddle is as old as the hills; mr. brown paid no attention whatever to nutkin. </br>	D:N
we can never conduct ourselves like that in this country. </br>	D:N
"aha! are you there? cried the soldier, ""get to your work at once! </br>"	A:A
"this shall be your pretty coffin, she said; ""and by and by, when my cousins come to visit me, they shall help me to bury you out in the garden; so that next summer you may grow up again more beautiful than ever."" </br>"	N:N
the old woman is right, said the robbers, and they ceased looking for the finger and sat down. </br>	N:N
the girl went into the forest and straight up to the little house. </br>	N:N
"no, said he, ""i do not ask my life; only to let me play upon my fiddle for the last time."" </br>"	F:N
the fisherman, however, fished this one also out of the water, and reared him. </br>	N:N
it is cold in the water, and i have stood here six hours. </br>	N:N
time passes away, and all things changed. </br>	N:N
then the woman clapped her hands, which frightened him still more. </br>	F:F
the daughter was taken into the forest where she was torn to pieces by wild beasts, but the witch was cast into the fire and miserably burnt. </br>	N:N
ah, it is because i have been to a church. </br>	H:N
"ah, said she, ""what bird of ill omen art thou?"" </br>"	Sa:F
they flew over forests and villages to show what they could do, for they had a long journey before them. </br>	N:N
i know where chippy is; a little bird told me, said mrs. chippy hackee. </br>	N:N
he had something else to say, which made him hesitate in a strange manner. </br>	N:F
and they all rejoiced, and embraced him and kissed him without stopping. </br>	H:H
the sun shone in upon them so beautifully, that the swallow asked her if she would go with him; she could sit on his back, he said, and he would fly away with her into the green woods. </br>	H:N
"and again a second time it said these words."" </br>"	N:N
"so away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, ""my lord judge, grant me one last request."" </br>"	F:N
then one of them mentioned thyland in denmark, and spoke of her sorrows, of her woes, which were soon to cease, for so divine providence had willed it. </br>	Sa:N
if one appeared before him, he would put himself in a terrible rage. </br>	N:N
so the tree with the black stork's nest was left standing; the tree itself, however, was not worth much to speak of. </br>	N:N
the pipe-head and the good head a family drama in one act characters </br>	N:N
the prince told him to send her. </br>	N:N
no, it is all lonely in the old man's house. </br>	Sa:N
"in the morning came the fox again and met him as he was beginning his journey, and said, ""go straight forward, till you come to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and on till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage; close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise you will repent it."" </br>"	N:N
his hand moved quickly, and his eye measured the great picture; and though nothing appeared but a faint line, the figure of the saviour was as clearly visible as in the colored picture. </br>	N:N
one flue seemed to lead into another. </br>	N:N
then it took the three pieces of the snake, laid them together, as they ought to go, and placed one of the leaves on each wound. </br>	N:N
he smelt the party and came up the bank, but he could not squeeze in at the door. </br>	N:N
the two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. </br>	N:N
the toad did not hear any more, nor did she understand half of what she had heard. </br>	N:N
but the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth. </br>	D:Su-
he mounted the steps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden goblet full of wine in front of her. </br>	N:N
he was as thin as a lath, wrinkled round the mouth and eyes, had long, bony fingers, bushy, gray eyebrows, and over his left eye hung a thick tuft of hair, which did not look handsome, but made his appearance very remarkable. </br>	N:N
these are the words of the song, but each only sang what he could remember of them in his own way. </br>	N:N
"the little tree said, ""then i will shake myself,"" and began to shake herself so that all her leaves fell off; a girl who came up with her water-pitcher saw that, and said, ""little tree, why art thou shaking thyself?"" </br>"	N:N
but when he gazed at the red hearts, their colors glowed more deeply, even as flames, and his memory followed each in turn. </br>	N:N
and what has become of the little elder-tree mother? asked the boy. </br>	N:N
she took the queen by the hand and led her to heaven, and showed her there her two eldest children, who smiled at her, and were playing with the ball of the world. </br>	N:N
"the fourth was too pale, and she called him ""wallface."" </br>"	D:N
so there was plenty of room for a little tom cat. </br>	N:N
it was most conspicuous. </br>	N:N
"authur o'bower has broken his band, he comes roaring up the land!
67:67	h:n	n:n	the king of scots with all his power, cannot turn arthur of the bower! </br>"	H:N
when the king heard that he owed the victory to him alone, he raised him above all the others, gave him great treasures, and made him the first in the kingdom. </br>	H:N
then she hurried away with her lover. </br>	F:N
it began to snow too; and the snow-flakes, as they fell upon her, were like a whole shovelful falling upon one of us, for we are tall, but she was only an inch high. </br>	N:N
"yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day.
51:51	n:n	s:n	then will i go forth and learn how to shudder, and then i shall, at any rate, understand one art which will support me. </br>"	Sa:N
then he went out and cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made her fingers very sore. </br>	A:N
then they let him lie quietly on the bench until the next morning, and when he awoke they gave him the letter, and showed him the right way. </br>	N:N
then snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she could wait no longer. </br>	F:N
ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down her cheeks! </br>	Sa:Sa
so the little girl went on with her little naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold. </br>	N:N
"how will you prove that to me?"" </br>"	A:F
"not so, said care, ""he went away of himself, he was not summoned. </br>"	D:N
the next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and sisters were gone, ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said: </br>	N:N
when the first cock crowed, the manikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her in her bed. </br>	N:N
"and when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of her, ""i will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in two hours"" time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast too."" </br>"	A:N
the customers come again and again, and buy quantities, in spite of being afraid of ginger and pickles. </br>	N:F
see, i am coming with a train, said the darning-needle, drawing a long thread after her; but there was no knot in the thread. </br>	N:N
"duchess reflected--""what a very awkward thing to have to explain to ribby! </br>"	F:N
so as soon as he reached home he took the largest sack he could find and went over to little claus. </br>	N:N
"his tail is sticking out!
148:148	d:n	d:n	you did not fetch enough dough, anna maria. </br>"	D:N
out in the garden there was a great festival. </br>	N:N
the day passed heavily. </br>	N:N
i understand the song of that bird very well, said the young sparrows. </br>	N:N
he ate wasp nests and frogs and worms; and he waddled about by moonlight, digging things up. </br>	N:N
if one could only get as high as that! </br>	Su+:N
he looked smart, for his shirt-frill, in which he had stuck a breast-pin, and his ruffles, were very fine. </br>	N:N
the man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. </br>	N:H
"then he got up and clambered out of the cave, went into the forest, and thought, ""here i am quite alone and deserted, how shall i obtain a horse now?"" </br>"	Sa:Sa
"then they said, ""the old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one in when we are away."" </br>"	A:N
the largest green leaf in this country is certainly the burdock-leaf. </br>	N:N
in the village i just came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. </br>	N:N
goodness of material ought to be appreciated. </br>	N:N
i will get some worms and go fishing and catch a dish of minnows for my dinner, said mr. jeremy fisher. </br>	N:N
then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into pieces and sprinkled salt upon it. </br>	N:N
"i am sure any one who does not enjoy this has no love for his fatherland."" </br>"	N:N
it is by pressure that a jewel is stamped. </br>	N:N
and pray what do you want? asked the farrier. </br>	N:N
we cannot control our wills, nor the feelings of our hearts, by the force of custom. </br>	N:N
the black ravens and crows flew on over the white snow. </br>	N:N
a perfectly lovely little black berkshire pig stood smiling beside him. </br>	H:H
"but wait a moment; it just comes into my mind, i require somebody to look after my pigs, for i have a great many."" </br>"	N:N
and so he lay quite still, while the shot rattled through the rushes, and gun after gun was fired over him. </br>	N:N
that was very mean. </br>	Su-:N
behave well, hans. </br>	A:N
take care of the bucket, for it will crush you to death; and even if you get into it safely, you may fall out. </br>	N:N
"what rumbles and tumbles against my poor bones?
49:49	n:n	f:-	i thought twas six kids, but it feels like big stones."" </br>"	F:Su-
but as the mice were going over, the straw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in and were drowned. </br>	N:N
in the night there was a terrible storm. </br>	F:N
no, said the witch. </br>	A:N
the dumpling had been peeled off tom kitten and made separately into a bag pudding, with currants in it to hide the smuts. </br>	N:N
on the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings, and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. </br>	Sa:N
it is not here like it was in your house opposite, when your father and mother talked so cheerfully together, while you and all the dear children made such a delightful noise. </br>	N:H
and the king then gave to each half a kingdom, as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have her again. </br>	H:H
he is very old. </br>	N:N
the woman became bitterly unkind to her step-daughter, and day by day did her best to treat her still worse. </br>	D:N
the king would not believe it, and would not suffer any one to do her any injury. </br>	N:N
that was a pleasure! </br>	H:H
that's exceedingly charming! cried little anna. </br>	H:N
he could not utter a word; he could only seize her hand and hold it fast in his own, but he felt too happy and glad to open his lips. </br>	H:H
she had been cross, unkind, and really spiteful to him; but he was very sorry, and took the dead woman and laid her in his warm bed to see if he could bring her to life again. </br>	Sa:Sa
"don't be angry, he pleaded; ""i received nothing, i have nothing at all;"" and he seized his mother's dress and would have kissed it. </br>"	F:N
jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story. </br>	Su+:H
"all his friends are dead; no one took care of him, and i was only a little boy."" </br>"	N:N
"alas! alas! said he, ""what a clever wife i have! </br>"	Su-:A
"the fifth, ""who has been handling my fork?"" </br>"	A:A
then i shall be obliged to lie out here, said little claus to himself, as the farmer's wife shut the door in his face. </br>	Sa:N
she has been accustomed to that, her mother said. </br>	N:N
"but the luck-child answered, ""i will fetch the golden hairs, i am not afraid of the devil;"" thereupon he took leave of them and began his journey. </br>"	N:N
then she wrapped herself up in a dry leaf, but it cracked in the middle and could not keep her warm, and she shivered with cold. </br>	Sa:N
certainly, he replied, and commenced at once, asking them to listen attentively. </br>	N:N
the box, however, did not sink, but floated like a boat, and not a drop of water made its way into it. </br>	N:N
this will serve as sufficient introduction to our tale. </br>	N:N
this certainly was not pleasant; but at last it was made into twelve garments of that kind which people do not like to name, and yet everybody should wear one. </br>	N:N
he turned away his head to hide it under his wing, and at the same moment a large terrible dog passed quite near him. </br>	N:N
"he must be a well-educated swineherd.
36:36	n:n	n:h	go and ask him how much the instrument is. </br>"	N:N
the chinese were the first to leave, and the other fowls soon followed them. </br>	N:N
"if shes in want of a husband now, then will it please her to step below?"" </br>"	N:N
she drove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the poor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left school to the time he went back. </br>	F:F
it was, however, the seat on which the lord sat when he was at home, and from which he could see everything which happened on earth. </br>	N:N
yes, so it is, said the little girl in the tree. </br>	N:N
"she was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, ""i know he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
once upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel, called timmy tiptoes. </br>	N:N
"now the tom cat was the master of the house, and the hen was mistress, and they always said, ""we and the world,"" for they believed themselves to be half the world, and the better half too. </br>"	N:N
they read deep and learned books to him, and then the lightest and most trifling that could be found, but all to no purpose. </br>	Sa:N
there was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run out of his mouth. </br>	Sa:N
then came the farmer with a cudgel and struck him dead, but the fox bounded into the forest, glad to be rid of the old glutton. </br>	A:H
and as he still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into the water. </br>	Su-:N
suddenly a heavy shower of rain came falling from the clouds. </br>	N:N
"then as you have spoken to me kindly, and are wise enough to seek for advice, i will tell you how and where to go.
29:29	n:n	n:f	the water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and, that you may be able to reach it in safety, i will give you an iron wand and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three times with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying down inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they will let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the water of life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer the door will shut upon you for ever. </br>"	H:H
"ah, he sighed, ""if i were only on the other side of the alps now, it would be summer, and i should be able to get money on my letter of credit. </br>"	Sa:N
"gretel, however, ran like lightning to hansel, opened his little stable, and cried: ""hansel, we are saved! </br>"	H:H
"open the door, my princess dear, open the door to thy true love here!
35:35	n:a	n:n	and mind the words that thou and i said by the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade. </br>"	N:A
he thinks it is a very funny bird! </br>	H:N
each of them brought tiny a present; but the best gift was a pair of beautiful wings, which had belonged to a large white fly and they fastened them to tiny's shoulders, so that she might fly from flower to flower. </br>	N:N
"underneath the juniper-tree kywitt, kywitt, what a beautiful bird am i!"" </br>"	N:H
she behaves like a mad woman, said the neighbor's wife. </br>	N:N
quack, quack, said the mother, and then they all quacked as well as they could, and looked about them on every side at the large green leaves. </br>	N:N
then, as the young lads often do, he looked out for the elder girls. </br>	N:N
the doll's-house stood at the other side of the fire-place. </br>	N:N
"surely, said he, ""the whole seven must have forgotten themselves over some game of play""; and when he had waited still longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished them all turned into ravens. </br>"	A:A
then he took leave of his friends, and hung his bag and bow about his neck, and went his way. </br>	H:N
why! </br>	N:N
"then, replied the mother, ""all the storks in the country will assemble together, and go through their autumn manoeuvres, so that it is very important for every one to know how to fly properly. </br>"	N:N
"come buy, come try, come buy!"" </br>"	N:N
"oh, said jack the dullard, ""i can hardly tell you. </br>"	H:H
the boy became a youth; he was to go out into the wide world, far away to the countries where the coffee grows. </br>	N:N
"it hides half the world from me, but i don't care for the world."" </br>"	D:N
we knelt down together on the altar steps, and anastasia drew near and stood beside us. </br>	N:N
but, grandmother, what big eyes you have! she said. </br>	Su-:N
then he showed them the mark, and they knew that what he had said was true. </br>	N:N
ib looked at the little girl, and thought of christina in her young days. </br>	N:N
then she seated herself on the edge of the drawer, and thought that perhaps one of the flowers would ask her to dance; but none of them came. </br>	N:N
now i see that it is sunday, said the husband, kissing his little wife. </br>	H:N
"then were the three mantles brought thither by the servant, and when the judges saw the misty-grey one which the king""s daughter usually wore, they said, ""let the mantle be embroidered with gold and silver, and then it will be your wedding-mantle. </br>"	N:N
the mouse apologized profusely, and said that she knew peter rabbit. </br>	N:N
the sun was shining, the birds were singing, and the confirmed children sang too, holding each other by the hand, for they had no position yet, and they were all equal in the eyes of god. </br>	H:N
here he had rooted up the moss and wood sorrel. </br>	N:N
he crept into a fold of the damp linen, which certainly was not so comfortable a place to lie in as the warm stable, but there was nothing better, so he remained lying there for a whole day and night, and the rain kept on all the time. </br>	N:N
"the cow-herd said: ""all right,"" and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set it among the grass. </br>"	N:N
so the top was brought again to notice and honor, but nothing more was heard of the little ball. </br>	N:N
so the brothers agreed that this plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who had no mind to have them. </br>	H:H
"wife, wife, said the man, ""why should we wish to be the king? </br>"	N:N
then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they crawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where the tailor had sewn them together. </br>	N:N
"i am certainly no judge of your singing so i keep my beak shut, which is better than talking nonsense, as others do."" </br>"	N:N
"we can all three travel together, with one or two more of our good friends."" </br>"	H:N
all that botanists can say in many lectures was explained in a moment by this little flower. </br>	N:N
she remembered that the route by the sea-shore was two miles shorter than by the high road; and as the weather was clear, and there would be moonlight, she determined to make her way on foot, and to start at once, that she might reach home the next day. </br>	N:N
he did lock the cupboard door; but without properly shutting it. </br>	N:N
"but the king""s son soon fell asleep; and when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been dancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. </br>"	N:N
then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the castle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one saw him. </br>	N:N
now we are there, and roll past between barns and other farm buildings; and at the left of the gate we turn aside to the old castle farm, where the lime trees stand in lines along the walls, and, sheltered from the wind and weather, grow so luxuriantly that their twigs and leaves almost conceal the windows. </br>	N:N
he kissed us all, and had so much to tell of what he had seen of the great ocean, of the fortifications at malta, and of the marvellous sepulchres of egypt, that i looked up to him with a kind of veneration. </br>	N:N
"this certainly was a very different sort of husband to the son of a toad, or the mole, with my black velvet and fur; so she said, ""yes,"" to the handsome prince. </br>"	H:N
from that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest, and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen of it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. </br>	N:N
they took them off the scarecrow. </br>	N:N
farewell, farewell, she repeated, twining her arm round a little red flower that grew just by her side. </br>	Sa:N
no, it was yesterday, replied the boy. </br>	N:N
when they heard it they were like people intoxicated; however it must have been with drinking tea, which is quite a chinese custom. </br>	N:H
before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. </br>	H:Sa
so the wedding-day was fixed, on which the mole was to fetch tiny away to live with him, deep under the earth, and never again to see the warm sun, because he did not like it. </br>	N:N
it had been sown with lettuces. </br>	N:N
he bobbed up and down like a little red cherry, singing-- </br>	N:N
when they stood up there were several green smears! </br>	N:N
it will be a fine one! </br>	A:N
we have nothing to lose, remarked the father. </br>	N:N
the stars became visible in broad daylight, large and sparkling, like clear and gentle eyes. </br>	N:N
we are pleased to hear that, said the two weavers, and described to him the colours and explained the curious pattern. </br>	H:H
the ravens croaked as the raven had done which she saw in the daytime, but now she understood what they said. </br>	N:N
"mother, said the boy, ""how dreadful you look! </br>"	F:F
"just such a large tree, covered with flowers, stands out there; it grew in the corner of an humble little yard; under this tree sat two old people one afternoon in the beautiful sunshine.
28:28	h:h	h:h	he was an old, old sailor, and she his old wife; they had already great-grandchildren, and were soon to celebrate their golden wedding, but they could not remember the date, and the elder-tree mother was sitting in the tree and looked as pleased as this one here.
29:29	n:n	h:h	'i know very well when the golden wedding is to take place,' she said; but they did not hear it- they were talking of bygone days.
30:30	n:n	h:h	'well, do you remember?' said the old sailor, 'when we were quite small and used to run about and play- it was in the very same yard where we now are- we used to put little branches into the ground and make a garden.' </br>"	N:N
"we know it, we know it,"" and the flowers nodded with their heads in a peculiar manner. </br>"	N:N
when once the conscience is awakened, it springs up in the heart spontaneously, and god awakens the conscience when we least expect it. </br>	N:N
sometimes peter rabbit had no cabbages to spare. </br>	N:N
"then eldest once went out with some other boys to fish, but the other boys would not have him with them, and said, ""go thy way, foundling."" </br>"	N:N
anne lisbeth walked on thus with her senses half asleep, but the thoughts were fermenting within her. </br>	N:N
and the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever was heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other. </br>	H:H
the moment he put the cap on he dreamed of unfortunate love, of bankruptcy, and of dark days. </br>	N:N
"did not you ask it for anything? said the wife, ""we live very wretchedly here, in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug little cottage."" </br>"	D:A
and one day a little old woman ran up and down in a red spotty cloak. </br>	N:N
"the presents of gold and precious stones which had been received with it were round the bird, and it was now advanced to the title of ""little imperial toilet singer,"" and to the rank of no. 1 on the left hand; for the emperor considered the left side, on which the heart lies, as the most noble, and the heart of an emperor is in the same place as that of other people. </br>"	N:N
large poppies and peonies had pea-shells for instruments, and blew into them till they were quite red in the face. </br>	N:N
the watchman thanked him, and also gave him two asses laden with gold. </br>	H:N
"no, answered the man, ""it is not by heiberg; godfred von gehman brought it out."" </br>"	N:N
hunca munca stood up in her chair, and chopped at the ham with another lead knife. </br>	N:N
"ribby stared with amazement-- ""did you ever see the like! so there really was a patty-pan? </br>"	Su-:Su-
then the paper was tied in a bundle with other papers, and thrown into a tub that stood in the washhouse. </br>	N:N
and all the while she was really the loveliest creature that one could imagine, and as tender and delicate as a beautiful rose-leaf. </br>	N:N
when the king came home they told him that the queen had been delivered of a dog. </br>	N:N
"all right! said he; ""those two have had their share."" </br>"	H:Su+
"softly, softly, do not talk so big.

"the next morning, when the two girls got up, there stood before the man""s daughter milk for her to wash in and wine for her to drink, but before the woman""s daughter stood water to wash herself with and water for drinking. </br>"	N:N
"opposite the old nunnery is the deepest place, which is called the ""bell-deep,"" and there dwells the old water spirit, the ""au-mann."" </br>"	N:N
"but it doesn't matter; you are equally welcome."" </br>"	H:N
he was further annoyed by the jay bird which followed him persistently. </br>	A:A
"in the yard, however, he took a tree in his hand, showed it to the bailiff, and said, ""isn""t that a fine bundle of wood?"" </br>"	N:N
indeed, outside it was not at all like the pastor's sermon. </br>	N:N
gambling hansel. </br>	N:N
one would have thought that something important was going on in the duck-pond, but it was nothing after all. </br>	N:N
the trees grew amongst heaped up rocks; and there, beneath a crag, mr. tod had made one of his homes. </br>	N:N
who is the dead man? we asked. </br>	Sa:N
"then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round their father""s neck. </br>"	H:H
that was terrible to hear, and he said it in such a tone of conviction; he described hell to them as a miserable hole where all the refuse of the world gathers. </br>	N:N
then will you give me the beautiful golden sword and that rich banner? and will you give me the emperor's crown? said the bird. </br>	N:N
the dogs come and devour the bacon. </br>	H:N
all besides was a scream, quite as unintelligible as the warbling of the canary-bird, excepting to the clerk, who being now a bird, could understand his comrades very well. </br>	N:N
where have you the calf, hans? </br>	N:N
mr. tod slapped his stick upon the earth and fumed; he guessed where tommy brock had gone to. </br>	A:A
"i wish you would give them to me, said the other; ""i am very poor."" </br>"	Sa:N
they came to the river, they came to the bridge--they crossed it hand in hand--then over the hills and far away she danced with pigling bland! </br>	H:H
in the morning mr. piperson made more porridge; the weather was warmer. </br>	N:N
"when he is fat, i will eat him."" </br>"	Su-:H
she was now the queen, and they lived for a long time happily together; the roebuck was tended and cherished, and ran about in the palace-garden. </br>	H:N
a bushel of money, for each, replied great claus. </br>	N:N
early in the morning, a peasant, who was passing by, saw what had happened. </br>	N:N
"and the prince said, ""i am going in search of the water of life, because my father is ill, and like to die: can you help me? </br>"	N:Su+
the third now got out. </br>	N:N
the first thing ib did that evening was to take out of his pocket the little black nut, in which the best thing of all was said to be enclosed. </br>	N:N
and grandpapa took a newspaper, and read as if he were reading from it: </br>	N:N
"among them was a singer, and he approached the royal spirit, and said, ""why mournest thou, and wherefore dost thou suffer thus?"" </br>"	N:N
they are dressed up in the most splendid manner. </br>	H:N
you were standing quietly, with your hands folded, and your father and mother. </br>	N:N
i know not whether the clear, blue atmosphere gleamed with its own light, or if the radiance came from the stars; but we could distinguish quite plainly the outline of the mountains. </br>	N:N
when they came near the wood at the top of bull banks, they went cautiously. </br>	F:F
but the second son could not settle at home, and took his cross-bow and went a-hunting. </br>	N:N
and where the sun shone, how everything glittered and sparkled, as if diamond dust had been strewn about; while the snowy carpet of the earth appeared as if covered with diamonds, from which countless lights gleamed, whiter than even the snow itself. </br>	N:N
"the old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done this when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with them.
65:65	n:n	n:f	they gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and yellow, and with that she died. </br>"	N:N
after a while the laundress recovered herself, and they led her to her poor dwelling, and put her to bed. </br>	N:N
for a moment the little ones stood silent with astonishment, and then they shouted for joy, till the room rang, and they danced merrily round the tree, while one present after another was taken from it. </br>	H:H
in the garden all the apple-trees were in blossom. </br>	N:N
peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops! </br>	F:F
what is this woman's name? asked the little boy. </br>	N:N
aunt pettitoes sighed and grunted, and addressed those little pigs as follows-- </br>	Sa:Sa
a minute afterwards, hunca munca, his wife, put her head out, too; and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery, she ventured out on the oilcloth under the coal-box. </br>	N:N
when the beloved object has lain for five years in a gutter, and has been drenched through, no one cares to know her again on meeting her in a dust-bin. </br>	N:N
when he awoke, strengthened and restored, the sun shone brightly through the window; but not one of his servants had returned- they all believed he was dead; only the nightingale still sat beside him, and sang. </br>	N:N
actually, there were crabs. </br>	N:N
benjamin was so excited that it was a mercy he did not awake tommy brock, whose snores continued solemnly in mr. tod's bed. </br>	H:H
after a time a second snake crept out of the hole, and when it saw the other lying dead and cut in pieces, it went back, but soon came again with three green leaves in its mouth. </br>	N:N
give me one hair- only one single hair- from the head of the sinner for whom the fire shall never be extinguished, of the sinner whom god will condemn to eternal punishment in hell. </br>	N:N
she said she could feel six, but they must be old rabbits, because they were so hard and all different shapes. </br>	N:N
many persons came round her, and lame martha ran into the house for help. </br>	N:N
"hold fast, hold fast."" </br>"	N:N
would her husband and her daughters flit past? </br>	N:N
but the garter was naturally shy, and did not know how to answer such a question. </br>	N:F
"the next morning the nurse asked the guards whether anyone had come into the palace during the night, but they answered, ""no, we have seen no one."" </br>"	N:N
"then the fox answered, ""i know a farm-yard where there are two young lambs; if thou art inclined, we will fetch one of them."" </br>"	N:N
"this tree i shall guard and cherish, she said, ""that it may grow large by christmas eve, and reach from the ground to the ceiling, to be covered and adorned with flaming candles, golden apples, and little figures. </br>"	H:N
timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs hurted him. </br>	Sa:Sa
it is a curious man's nest all the same; and what have they put up here? </br>	N:N
instead of answering me, he began to laugh loudly. </br>	N:N
and as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep. </br>	N:Sa
"the miller thought to himself: ""the wolf wants to deceive someone,"" and refused; but the wolf said: ""if you will not do it, i will devour you."" </br>"	A:A
but the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder brother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the heart of the mountains. </br>	N:N
"this is the black goblin's fault, i am sure.
41:41	n:n	n:-	ah, well, if the little lady were only here with me in the boat, i should not care for any darkness. </br>"	N:N
in a forest of his country lived two giants, who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging, and burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in danger of death. </br>	F:N
the fish swam to and fro, making the most wonderful movements, but at last he became quite still. </br>	N:N
nobody got anything by it; indeed, no one even heard what the good thing was. </br>	N:N
"is that seemly?"" </br>"	A:N
"it makes me unhappy to think that i shall die, and leave this poor child,"" sighed she. </br>"	Sa:Sa
they were so poor, however, that they no longer had daily bread, and did not know how to get food for her. </br>	N:N
"well, said hans, ""if she is not really smart, i won""t have her."" </br>"	N:N
"now we'll go into the theatre.
5:5	n:n	n:n	here we will put up a book, there another, and there a third, in a sloping row.

10:10	n:n	n:n	let us see what we can find in the plaything-box.
11:11	n:n	n:n	first the personages, and then we will get the play ready.
12:12	n:n	n:n	one after the other; that will be capital!
13:13	n:n	n:n	here's a pipe-head, and yonder an odd glove; they will do very well for father and daughter. </br>"	N:N
so they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them, were still unconsumed. </br>	N:H
and then, how funny it was to see the tricks he would perform to amuse them. </br>	N:N
the first twig, dear father, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come homewards, said she. </br>	N:N
"ah! said hans aloud, ""what a fine thing it is to ride on horseback! </br>"	Su+:N
little tuk did not at all know what he had dreamt, but one above did. </br>	N:N
what misfortune has happened then? asked he. </br>	F:Su-
it never occurred to him that these could be goloshes of fortune. </br>	N:N
she flew beautifully when she had got a good start. </br>	N:N
i shall find him again, said the old man, but he did not find him. </br>	N:N
oh, what sweet fragrance there was in his chambers! and how clean and beautiful were the walls! for they were the blushing leaves of the rose. </br>	N:N
the poor school-boys did not even sing a psalm when the former lord of borreby was laid in the earth to rest. </br>	N:N
there has been really more done for us than for any other creature; it is quite plain that we are the most noble people in the world. </br>	N:H
"wizz!"" </br>"	N:N
they will be very proud when they find that i am going to marry a turkish angel; but you must think of some very pretty stories to tell them, for my parents like to hear stories better than anything. </br>	N:N
"but tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again, ""how much will you have? </br>"	N:N
he folded up the newspaper and put it in his coattail pocket. </br>	N:N
"go home, said the fish; ""she is king already."" </br>"	N:N
there had only been a kind of twilight all day, and it soon grew quite dark, and so bitterly cold, that the skipper took a dram to warm him. </br>	N:N
"i can feel such pricks and stabs in my left leg; i am sure there is going to be a change."" </br>"	N:N
"how can you ask? said hans; ""i should be the happiest man in the world, if i could have money whenever i put my hand in my pocket: what could i want more? there""s the goose."" </br>"	H:H
you can't go in the dark, said pigling bland. </br>	N:N
"oh, that the evening were come, thought the tree, ""and the tapers lighted! then i shall know what else is going to happen. </br>"	H:N
"many portraits hang there that none seem to trouble themselves about.
49:49	n:n	n:n	the persons they represent have been dead and buried long since.
50:50	n:n	n:n	but i knew this lady many years ago, and she has been dead nearly half a century. </br>"	N:N
here she slept at night, but during the day she amused herself on a table, where the woman had placed a plateful of water. </br>	H:H
it's a drop of puddle water! said kribble-krabble. </br>	Su+:Su-
and she drew the goloshes from his feet. </br>	N:N
"that i may catch the kings daughter""s golden apple."" </br>"	H:N
the poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. </br>	Sa:Sa
there was less smoke, but tom kitten felt quite lost. </br>	F:F
i could not get them to venture in. </br>	N:N
"and when she was grown up, the king looked at her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to his courtiers, ""may i not marry my daughter? </br>"	N:N
mrs. tittlemouse went round with a mop. </br>	N:N
while tom kitten was left alone under the floor of the attic, he wriggled about and tried to mew for help. </br>	F:F
"wife, go home, and give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on as long as he lives."" </br>"	N:N
"i will take care of that.
66:66	n:n	n:-	come, give me your arm.
67:67	n:n	n:-	the boy can stay here and take care of the linen, and i'll come back and finish the washing; it is but a trifle. </br>"	N:N
a great iron-bound door stood ajar; he passed through, and climbed up a brick staircase, with dirty walls and a rope for a balustrade, till he came to an open gallery hung with rags. </br>	N:N
but from this time forth the king had to ferry, as a punishment for his sins. </br>	N:N
"so the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse: ""i want to tell you something, little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and i am to hold him over the font at the christening. </br>"	H:Sa
beautiful children ran along the country lanes, playing with large gay butterflies; and as the swallow flew farther and farther, every place appeared still more lovely. </br>	N:N
and as soon as she was burnt the roebuck changed his shape, and received his human form again, so the sister and brother lived happily together all their lives. </br>	H:N
at length they reached the warm countries, where the sun shines brightly, and the sky seems so much higher above the earth. </br>	N:N
"then said the mother likewise: ""what a clever elsie we have!"" and sat down and wept with them. </br>"	Sa:Sa
"this is what i call something."" </br>"	N:N
"and holger danske did dream of the little humble room in which the image-carver sat; he heard all that had been said, and he nodded in his dream, saying, ""ah, yes, remember me, you danish people, keep me in your memory, i will come to you in the hour of need."" </br>"	H:N
oh; oh! they are coming back! </br>	F:F
"that stupid horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without mercy!"" </br>"	A:N
"when he came to his father""s house, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him, and said he had had but one son, his poor heinel, who he knew was long since dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would not even give him anything to eat. </br>"	N:Sa
he opened the door. </br>	N:N
"this rang pleasantly in the tailor""s ears; he stretched his delicate head out of the window, and called: ""come up here, dear woman; here you will get rid of your goods."" </br>"	H:H
when the king and his huntsmen again saw the young roebuck with the golden collar, they all chased him, but he was too quick and nimble for them. </br>	N:N
"then the king said to the young princess, ""as you have given your word you must keep it; so go and let him in."" </br>"	D:N
"my golden ball has fallen into the spring."" </br>"	Sa:N
mrs. tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle sniffle snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire. </br>	N:N
your pig may get you into a scrape. </br>	N:N
what a lucky fellow you are! exclaimed great claus. </br>	Su+:N
by degrees he ventured further in--right into the bed- room. </br>	N:N
i received quite as good food, or even better. </br>	N:N
but, naturally, being a thin- legged person (though vindictive and sandy whiskered)--he was quite unable to lift the heavy weight to the level of the hook and rope. </br>	N:N
"good day, dear mr fox, how are you?
2:2	n:n	h:n	how is all with you?
3:3	n:n	h:n	how are you getting on in these hard times? </br>"	H:N
when the king got to the bottom, he ordered cat-skin to be called once more, and soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it. </br>	N:Su+
a hot tear rolled into her lap, and formed itself into a pearl, glowing with all the colors of the rainbow. </br>	Sa:N
then she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness. </br>	H:H
the supper made its appearance at last. </br>	N:N
he was overjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he fell back again. </br>	H:H
i would fain fly away now; but if you weep for me as you are weeping now, you may never see me again. </br>	N:N
now i do not know, and probably even they don't know themselves, for we live in strange times. </br>	N:N
play on, play on, thou little maiden! </br>	Sa:N
one spring day the sun shone brightly, and he was guiding the plough across his field. </br>	N:N
not known in any system! repeated the thistles and the nettles. </br>	D:N
just over the fowls sat the owl, with father owl and the little owls. </br>	N:N
on the coast a ship is stranded; and the bishop's warriors are there, and spare not those whom the sea has spared. </br>	N:N
let me look at the egg. </br>	N:N
"and the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the pigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit, with the goose for the king""s dinner upon it; the butler finished his draught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave the boy the box on his ear. </br>"	N:Su+
the roof, as far as one existed at all, was covered with moss and lichen. </br>	N:N
the king was sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants, wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly have been rid of him again. </br>	A:Sa
"the youth heard it, got up, and said: ""it has not come to that yet."" </br>"	H:N
heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial! said hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to its leg. </br>	H:H
the branches of the old willow-tree rustled in the wind, and large water-drops fell from his green leaves as if the old willow were weeping. </br>	Sa:Sa
so the woodman at last said he would sell tom to the strangers for a large piece of gold, and they paid the price. </br>	N:N
mama purchased thirty copies of the paper, that she might cut out the paragraph and send it to friends and acquaintances. </br>	N:N
presently the scream of an eagle sounded through the wood; it was an ugly cry, and it frightened the children; but before them, in the thickest part of the forest, grew the most beautiful blackberries, in wonderful quantities. </br>	F:F
so hans set out, and she showed him the way to the mill. </br>	N:N
"what noise was that? said the thief, frightened; ""i""m sure i heard someone speak."" </br>"	F:F
at last he went to the judge, and complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his back and a fiddle hung round his neck. </br>	A:A
they belonged to her daughter; and surely no one who had such a daughter could be silly. </br>	N:N
not yet, pig-wig, he will look back. </br>	F:N
the corpse lay in a bedroom, near to the one in which we sat, and the old man was in great distress and weeping like a child. </br>	Sa:Sa
i shall make my fortune--to be cut bias--the mayor of gloucester is to be married on christmas day in the morning, and he hath ordered a coat and an embroidered waistcoat-- </br>	N:N
"her waist is quite slim.

"when her courage returned she said, ""thou hast not won me yet by that; there is still something else that thou must do. </br>"	N:N
the better to hear you with, my child, was the reply. </br>	N:N
cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k! </br>	A:N
you have genius, but no discretion. </br>	N:N
so he got nothing by it but vexation, trouble, abuse, and the loss of his horse; but the poor people lived happily, quietly, and piously until their happy death. </br>	H:H
every evening i have permission to take home to my poor sick mother the scraps from the table; she lives down by the sea-shore, and as i come back i feel tired, and i sit down in the wood to rest, and listen to the nightingale's song. </br>	N:N
our play is much better, said grandpapa. </br>	H:N
but the tailor came out of his shop and shuffled home through the snow. </br>	N:N
it was in all other ways its own master, but even of that one may get tired. </br>	N:N
it was in vain that the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father, for that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber door was locked, and she was left alone. </br>	Sa:Sa
he looked about for a nice convenient place, and he fixed upon the chimney. </br>	N:N
inside the house the rooms were very high and had ceilings of beams, and that was very useful considering the great deal of smoke which rose up from the chimney fire where the large, damp logs of wood smouldered. </br>	N:N
at home the shoes were put into the cupboard, but karen could not help looking at them. </br>	N:N
when the dance was over, the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well, that he thought he had never tasted any so good before. </br>	H:H
"she gave each a little piece of bread, and said: ""there is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else."" </br>"	N:A
her brother often came into the room, and would be quite cheerful, in spite of his base conduct; so she dare not say a word to him of her heart's grief. </br>	N:H
and in his haughtiness and foolish presumption he ordered a magnificent ship to be constructed, with which he could sail through the air; it was gorgeously fitted out and of many colours; like the tail of a peacock, it was covered with thousands of eyes, but each eye was the barrel of a gun. </br>	N:N
then molly was the only one who dared to resist him. </br>	N:N
it seemed as if something immense had been thrown over him. </br>	N:N
but the cockchafer did not trouble himself at all about the matter. </br>	N:N
"did you meet them?"" </br>"	N:N
let the thing sit there and enjoy its life. </br>	N:N
we will try to do so, at least, said his wife. </br>	N:N
"but the buckwheat spread itself out with pride, and said, ""stupid tree; he is so old that grass grows out of his body."" </br>"	A:A
"most certainly i shall, replied jack the dullard; and again the brothers laughed and rode on, and thus they got far in advance of him; but- ""hallo- hop rara!"" and there was jack the dullard again. </br>"	H:Su-
no, you gave it me for playing a tune to you. said the countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the matter short by ordering him off to the gallows. </br>	A:A
"but when he went on and related all about christmas-eve, and how he had been dressed up with cakes and lights, the mice said, ""how happy you must have been, you old fir-tree."" </br>"	H:N
"then he shook his head and said, ""it cannot possibly be the bishop himself."" </br>"	Su-:N
she was very fond of the poor swallow. </br>	N:N
"i saw it when it was part of the castle of marck stig on the promontory.
3:3	n:n	n:n	but the castle was obliged to be pulled down, and the stone was used again for the walls of a new mansion on another spot- the baronial residence of borreby, which still stands near the coast.

7:7	n:n	n:n	his wife, in garments embroidered with gold, stepped proudly over the polished marble floors.
8:8	n:n	n:n	the tapestries were gorgeous, and the furniture of costly and artistic taste.

"oh, said he, ""do you want to win the three groschen too?"" </br>"	N:N
"at last came the little dwarf""s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat down upon a stone and cried. </br>"	Sa:Sa
he next told them how he was king of the golden mountain, and was married to a princess, and had a son seven years old. </br>	N:N
the woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him. </br>	A:A
scream as he might, it would not help him. </br>	F:F
all the hyacinths and tulips stood in two long rows down the room, not a single flower remained in the window, and the flower-pots were all empty. </br>	N:N
then the little cock took the water to the hen, but when he got there the hen had choked in the meantime, and lay there dead and motionless. </br>	Su-:N

ribby and tabitha rushed upstairs again. </br>	N:N
benjamin bunny set off at once after tommy brock. </br>	A:N

whither away, hans? </br>	N:N
peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. </br>	F:F
but just look at all the others, are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw? </br>	H:N
"good night, my masters! said he, ""i""m off! mind and look sharp after me the next time."" </br>"	H:H
how much came back to his remembrance as he looked through the tears once more on his native town! </br>	Sa:Sa
"i passed on in my course, said the wind, ""and he passed away also. </br>"	N:N
"the huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself: ""how the old woman is snoring! </br>"	N:N
that flourishes still, said he, as he gazed. </br>	H:N
tom thumb set to work at once to carve the ham. </br>	N:N
i must do everything you bid me, said the little man. </br>	N:N
"when she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he stretched out his feet and said: ""pull off my boots,"" and then he threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean and brighten them. </br>"	A:N
"the swallow sang, ""tweet, tweet,"" and from his song came the whole story. </br>"	N:N
who knows whether we shall find anything better to-day? said the servant; so he killed the raven, and took it with him. </br>	N:N
it became very cold, the dew fell, and the wind blew; so he thought the best thing he could do would be to return home. </br>	N:N
one day two swindlers came to this city; they made people believe that they were weavers, and declared they could manufacture the finest cloth to be imagined. </br>	N:N
"yus, yus, yus, said aunt pettitoes, ""there will be more to eat without them."" </br>"	Sa:N
the porter's bell he was unable to reach, and however was he to get loose! </br>	N:N
"good man, cried he, ""pray get me out of this scrape. </br>"	F:F
but it will soon come. </br>	N:N
there was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very young, and barely able to run alone. </br>	N:N
"but, said little ida, ""is there no one there to hurt the flowers for dancing in the king's castle?"" </br>"	N:N
"mew!
76:76	n:n	n:n	mew! interrupted simpkin, and he scratched at the door. </br>"	N:N
"i shall be obliged to propose to the hair-brush, thought the shirt collar; so he remarked one day, ""it is wonderful what beautiful hair you have, my little lady. </br>"	N:N
"the cock is crowing, said the old elfin maiden who acted as housekeeper; now we must close the shutters, that the sun may not scorch us."" </br>"	N:N
very much? </br>	N:N
the child's arms were round the neck of the pig, and he was in a deep sleep. </br>	N:N
the third said that he never went into strange places if his parents were not with him; he had always been a good child, and wished to remain so, even after being confirmed, and they ought not to tease him for this; they, however, did it all the same. </br>	N:N
presently one of the little boys took up the tin soldier, and threw him into the stove. </br>	N:N
oh what a splendid sight there was to be sure! </br>	H:N
"when the countryman saw so much money, he said, ""i will agree to your proposal."" </br>"	Su+:N
"no, answered they, ""he""s a foundling. </br>"	N:N
"i will be pope next."" </br>"	N:N
what would become of this young man, and what would become of the old bell? </br>	N:N
the elfin maidens we're already dancing on the elf hill, and they danced in shawls woven from moonshine and mist, which look very pretty to those who like such things. </br>	H:N
he sat down by her side and talked to her: he said her eyes were like beautiful dark lakes, in which the thoughts swam about like little mermaids, and he told her that her forehead was a snowy mountain, which contained splendid halls full of pictures. </br>	N:N
"she took care to do everything according to the old woman""s bidding and every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. </br>"	N:N
then the door opened. </br>	N:N
close to the corner of a street, among other abodes of poverty, stood an exceedingly tall, narrow house, which had been so knocked about by time that it seemed out of joint in every direction. </br>	N:N
"i cannot very well describe it, said the sculptor; ""but you enter on a large open space, in the centre of which stands an obelisk, which is a thousand years old."" </br>"	N:N
"i have been playing at ninepins, he answered, ""and have lost a couple of farthings."" </br>"	Sa:N
then he sprang out of bed quickly, and read over his lesson in the book, and knew it all at once quite correctly. </br>	N:N
he sat such a while that he had to be asked if he would take some dinner? </br>	N:N
then his daughter came to him and said it was getting late, that he ought to rest for a while, and that the supper was on the table. </br>	N:N
ah, yes; that is indeed a noble heart in the danish arms, said the grandfather. and his spirit followed the second flame, which carried him out to sea, where cannons roared and the ships lay shrouded in smoke, and the flaming heart attached itself to the breast of hvitfeldt in the form of the ribbon of an order, as he blew himself and his ship into the air in order to save the fleet. </br>	N:N
and other squirrels began to dig,--the whole wood was in commotion! </br>	N:N
"he's a bad kitten, cousin tabitha; he made a cat's cradle of my best bonnet last time i came to tea.
23:23	n:n	n:n	where have you looked for him? </br>"	D:A
"so when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ""grete, that is the second."" </br>"	N:N
how very short. </br>	N:N
"i will go and seek my brothers."" </br>"	N:N
he played at our house before he played in the presence of kings, said the burgomaster's wife. </br>	N:N
yes, but seat thyself at the back of the carriage, for in the front my little horses could not drag thee. </br>	N:N
"and there is also no ferry, answered gretel, ""but a white duck is swimming there: if i ask her, she will help us over."" </br>"	N:H
"then they went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, ""well, brother, you found the water of life, did you? </br>"	Su+:D
the door flew open at the third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on through the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. </br>	N:N
is it true what they say, that she was good for nothing? </br>	Sa:N
"then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him: ""if the case be as you say, i will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only i make one condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated, and i will care for it like a mother."" </br>"	D:N
one day frederick said. </br>	N:N
and from this time forth everyone could again go into the forest with safety. </br>	H:N
"they are like wet wood, he would say, looking round to see what sort of people were present, ""this evening; nothing fires them."" </br>"	D:N
"oh, just let some peas be strewn in the ante-chamber, answered the lion, ""and then you will soon see. </br>"	N:N
in the course of the following november, her banns were published in the church on the heath, and also in copenhagen, where the bridegroom lived. </br>	N:N
"but the old witch made a deep sleep come upon him, and he said to the young lady, ""let us sit down and rest ourselves a little, i am so tired that i cannot stand any longer."" </br>"	Sa:N
they will come when there is the chance of a ship. </br>	N:N
"one of them in a blue coat, by himself, was busily hunting for dandelions.-- ""cousin peter! </br>"	N:N
in the yard, in an arbour formed by lilac bushes in full bloom, stood an open coffin; thither they had carried a dead man, who was to be buried that very afternoon. </br>	N:N
the whole night previous to the day on which the procession was to take place, the swindlers pretended to work, and burned more than sixteen candles. </br>	N:N
"it is polly's birthday, she added in a simpering tone, ""and the little field-bird has come to offer his congratulations."" </br>"	N:N
"then the fish came swimming to him, and said, ""well, what is her will? </br>"	N:N
he began to turn them over carefully, looking under each. </br>	N:N
like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it till she came to the oven. </br>	N:N
"cock-a-doodle-doo!
30:30	n:n	n:h	your golden daughters come back to you."" </br>"	N:N
good evening, mother. </br>	N:N
"whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it, it has lived so well!"" </br>"	N:H
"nay, answered the bird, ""i do not sing twice for nothing; give me that millstone, and i will sing it again."" </br>"	N:N
tom thumb was a mouse. </br>	N:N
we can't sing, certainly; but we have a sounding-board, or something of the kind, within us; we can feel that, though we don't talk about it. </br>	N:N
it is almost as if its leaves still smelt sweet! </br>	N:N
"then the king said, ""what god does, is well done!"" </br>"	N:N
"i used to see so many in the summer."" </br>"	N:N
they therefore drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water. </br>	Sa:N
but no one will imagine that he accomplished it. </br>	N:N
again he was the only one who caught the apple, and he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. </br>	H:N
"it's only all over with mr. de boots.
95:95	n:n	n:n	now the lovers kneel down, and one of them sings:
96:96	n:n	n:n	'father!' </br>"	N:N
then the boy went on his way and walked for many days, and at last he came to a great piece of water by the side of which stood an old woman fishing. </br>	N:N
then at last, after a long talk, they came to terms. </br>	N:N
but i cannot bear even that, and it was very foolish to give us punch and hot salmon; i shall speak about it to our hostess, the agent's lady. </br>	A:N
and his face and neck grew red as fire. </br>	N:N
pigling bland made no objection; he sat with his eyes half shut, and watched her. </br>	N:N
"yes, said the bailiff, ""i can make use of one; you look a strong fellow who can do something, how much a year do you want as wages?"" </br>"	N:N
on a sudden jorindel found himself free. </br>	Su+:N
what rejoicing there was! </br>	H:H
and the fir-tree thought of the pretty little birch-tree that grew in the forest, which was to him a real beautiful princess. </br>	H:N
"the young king, however, took the three snake-leaves with him, gave them to a servant and said, ""keep them for me carefully, and carry them constantly about thee; who knows in what trouble they may yet be of service to us!"" </br>"	N:N
we brushed their coats, we curled their tails and washed their little faces, and wished them good bye in the yard. </br>	N:N
they had been lying asleep for some time, when suddenly something was thrown into the yard for them to eat. </br>	N:N
then hansel sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. </br>	N:H
the little bird sang his own song merrily; in the street below there was driving and running to and fro, every one thought of his own affairs, or perhaps of nothing at all; but the bottle neck thought deeply. </br>	H:H
as soon as the autumn arrived, all the storks began to assemble together before taking their departure for warm countries during the winter. </br>	N:N
but the riding-whip said he never cracked for old people, only for the young who were not yet married. </br>	N:N
thereupon death climbed up, but when he wanted to come down again, he could not, and gambling hansel left him up there for seven years, during which time no one died. </br>	N:N
"and i feel sure that anna maria pockets things--
38:38	n:n	n:n	where are all the cream crackers?"" </br>"	D:N
with gretel. </br>	N:N
"now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad to see him, and said, ""are you at last come to set me free? </br>"	H:H
what did she see there? </br>	F:N
rapunzel, rapunzel, let down your hair to me. </br>	N:N
here is the chain, take it, said the goldsmith. </br>	N:N
snip, snap, snurre, basse lurre: the song is ended. </br>	Sa:N
gretel presents hans with a calf. </br>	H:N
"then said the youth, ""see, little cousin, have i not warmed you?"" </br>"	H:N
"little duck, little duck, dost thou see, hansel and gretel are waiting for thee?
127:127	n:n	n:+	theres never a plank, or bridge in sight, take us across on thy back so white."" </br>"	N:N
the carpet was thick and soft, like a covering of moss. </br>	N:N
"'leave it alone,' i sang down the chimney; 'leave it alone, it will all end in smoke, air, coals, and ashes, and you will burn your fingers.'
92:92	d:n	d:-	but waldemar daa did not leave it alone, and all he possessed vanished like smoke blown by me.
93:93	n:n	n:-	the splendid black horses, where are they?
94:94	n:n	n:-	what became of the cows in the field, the old gold and silver vessels in cupboards and chests, and even the house and home itself?
95:95	n:n	n:-	it was easy to melt all these away in the gold-making crucible, and yet obtain no gold.
96:96	n:n	n:-	and so it was.
97:97	n:n	s:-	empty are the barns and store-rooms, the cellars and cupboards; the servants decreased in number, and the mice multiplied.
98:98	n:n	s:-	first one window became broken, and then another, so that i could get in at other places besides the door.
99:99	d:n	d:n	'where the chimney smokes, the meal is being cooked,' says the proverb; but here a chimney smoked that devoured all the meals for the sake of gold.
100:100	n:n	s:n	i blew round the courtyard, said the wind, ""like a watchman blowing his home, but no watchman was there. </br>"	D:N
"well, now i know the world, said the beetle to himself; ""it's an abominable world; i'm the only respectable person in it. </br>"	D:N
cat-skin was brought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head. </br>	Sa:D
"madam, i beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; i will provide oats.
56:56	n:n	n:n	but before you commence your tedious sitting, i intend to give you a treat.
57:57	h:n	h:n	let us have a dinner party all to ourselves!
58:58	n:n	n:n	may i ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm garden to make a savory omelet? </br>"	N:N
he pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony. </br>	N:N
"the nuts are quite ripe now, said chanticleer to his wife partlet, ""suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can, before the squirrel takes them all away."" </br>"	N:N
however, it did something quite as important; it travelled to the place of its destination, and was unpacked. </br>	N:N
ah, do not go! cried the wife. </br>	F:F
the best thing the goloshes did </br>	N:N
then people heard the stories and poetry read, and it made them wiser and better; for all that was written had a good and sensible meaning, and a great blessing was contained in the words on this paper. </br>	N:N
"when the smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood before him, and said: ""lord, what are your commands?"" </br>"	Su+:N
now the cook lay in the next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and listened. </br>	F:Su-
i smote seven at one blow. </br>	N:N
he could not any longer endure to witness all this agony of grief, he therefore flew away to his own rose in the garden. </br>	N:N
then he became mad and blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture, glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without touching the bird at all. </br>	A:A
"very well, answered she, ""i""ll carry the door; but i""ll not carry the nuts and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if you please, i""ll fasten them to the door."" </br>"	N:N
"i will send you into another town, to another master."" </br>"	A:N
so the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf, till at last down it fell. </br>	N:N
here she was to stay for seven years without meat or drink, and die of hunger. </br>	N:A
and what is the bell telling? </br>	N:N
and as the sun rose and set, the bottle felt as at the time of its first existence, when in the heated glowing stove it had a longing to fly away. </br>	N:N
"prithee, friend, why so sorrowful? said he to the merchant; ""what is it you take so deeply to heart?"" </br>"	N:Sa
"in the morning when he awoke, the three days had passed, and a coach came with six horses and they shone so bright that it was delightful to see them! and a servant brought a seventh as well, which was for the poor miller""s boy. </br>"	H:H
then they tickled the ladies who waited at table, with the fir-cones, which they carried in their pockets. </br>	N:N
"he replied, ""a raven, which ate of a dead and poisoned horse, and died of it."" </br>"	N:N
when old mr fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the door, and the cat who was servant to mrs fox, opened it for him. </br>	N:N
"i say she was a good and worthy woman, and god, who is in heaven, knows i am speaking the truth, though the world may say, even now she was good for nothing."" </br>"	N:N
then it was quiet for a while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the chimney and fell before him. </br>	F:N
now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her revenge. </br>	A:A
then i will not have him. </br>	Sa:D
madam, have you lost your way? said he. </br>	N:N
not till you have opened the door for me, answered the man. </br>	A:N
the dark-blue sea was covered with white-sailed ships, and in the barns sat old women, girls, and children picking hops into a large tub; the young ones sang songs, and the old people told fairy tales about goblins and sorcerers. </br>	N:N
ribby and duchess said good-bye affectionately, and duchess started home. </br>	H:H
but gambling hansel instantly began to play again, and there was such a noise and confusion that there was no hearing what they themselves were saying. </br>	N:N
only sing me that again. </br>	N:Sa
i can trust you, for i believe that i do love you. </br>	H:H
you think yourself a promised bride, and that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that you will keep your marriage feast. </br>	N:N
then the old man came back with a pleasant face; and brought with him beautiful preserved fruits, as well as apples and nuts; and the little boy thought no more of the tin soldier. </br>	H:H
"see what a hurry they are in, said little claus, ""they are longing to get down again,"" ""come, help me, make haste,"" said great claus; ""or you'll get beaten."" </br>"	N:N
they would certainly kill him, he thought. </br>	F:N
where is the knife, hans? </br>	N:F
"four-and-twenty tailors went to catch a snail, the best man amongst them durst not touch her tail; she put out her horns like a little kyloe cow.
71:71	n:n	h:n	run, tailors, run!
72:72	n:n	h:n	or she'll have you all e'en now! </br>"	N:N
then we can find no excuse for ourselves; the deed is there and bears witness against us. </br>	N:N
what the devil said to your three questions, i suppose you heard? </br>	N:N
hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path. </br>	N:N
the witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the well, and went away. </br>	A:A
travelling expands the mind very much, said the beetle. </br>	N:N
when you are half-way over, throw it down, and out of the waters will immediately spring up a high nut-tree on which the griffin will be able to rest, otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole way; if, therefore, thou dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let you both fall into the sea. </br>	N:N
"then the king""s son wished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more beautiful than any painter could have painted her. </br>"	N:N
it was at this time dark, brown, and ugly, but had originally been formed of blooming olive and laurel branches, brought from beyond the mountains. </br>	N:N
when he tried him, his strength had increased so much that he could tear an old tree out of the ground. </br>	N:N
she sits upstairs in her room, bewailing her sorrowful doom, bewailing her trouble so sore, for old mr fox is no more. </br>	Sa:Sa
thou wouldst gladly go down and be with thy child, said a voice quite close to her,- a voice that sounded so deep and clear, that it went to her heart. </br>	N:N
"he saw a small wooden hut, made his way to it, and crept inside --""i am afraid it is a hen house, but what can i do?"" said pigling bland, wet and cold and quite tired out. </br>"	Sa:Sa
a second pig was drawn by the side of the first, and this looked a hundred times better; and the third attempt was so good, that everybody might know what it was meant to represent. </br>	H:N
it contains a free admission to a cabbage-garden, replied the mule. </br>	N:N
"gretel says to hans: ""i will go with you."" </br>"	H:N
when these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole high up a tree, that had belonged to a woodpecker; the nuts rattled down--down--down inside. </br>	N:N
"for somehow they couldn't say--
177:177	n:n	h:n	pig-wig's head bobbed lower and lower, until she rolled over, a little round ball, fast asleep on the hearth-rug.
178:178	n:n	h:n	pigling bland, on tiptoe, covered her up with an antimacassar.
179:179	f:f	f:f	he was afraid to go to sleep himself; for the rest of the night he sat listening to the chirping of the crickets and to the snores of mr. piperson overhead.
180:180	n:n	n:n	early in the morning, between dark and daylight, pigling tied up his little bundle and woke up pig- wig.
181:181	f:h	f:h	she was excited and half- frightened.
182:182	f:n	f:n	but it's dark! </br>"	N:N
but they still went on, and death nodded like a chinaman to all they said. </br>	N:N
"give me your daughter to wife."" </br>"	N:N
"alas! said the mouse, ""now i see what has happened, now it comes to light! </br>"	Su-:Su-
no doubt i shall still go forward. </br>	N:N
then it asked again, </br>	N:N
i lay on my back in the boat, anastasia leaned against me, while the stars above us glittered more brightly than the lamps in our church. </br>	N:N
he was in disgrace; flopsy wrung her ears, and slapped him. </br>	A:D
but when he came to the gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too must go away about his business; and away he went. </br>	N:N
he asked the youth what had become of the letter entrusted to him, and why he had brought another instead of it. </br>	N:N
"hallo, said the soldier; ""well this is a pleasant tinderbox, if it brings me all i wish for."" </br>"	H:N
they had something better to do than that. </br>	N:N
"they pretended to take the cloth from the loom, and worked about in the air with big scissors, and sewed with needles without thread, and said at last: ""the emperor's new suit is ready now."" </br>"	N:N
"the cook once more said: ""if you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life."" </br>"	A:A
and there met them a stalwart knight, with a train of twelve armed followers. </br>	N:N
which of these shall we take with us to heaven to be transplanted there? asked the angel. </br>	H:N
"wonderful weather this, cried one of them, ""and so refreshing. </br>"	H:H
tommy brock opened both eyes, and looked at the rope and grinned. </br>	H:D
"how is it with thee, friend? said he, ""dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? </br>"	N:H
they cut the apple of life in two and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him, and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age. </br>	H:H
this house was inhabited by poor people, but the deepest poverty was apparent in the garret lodging in the gable. </br>	N:N
the little toy theatre was therefore put up in such a way that the money-pig could look directly into it. </br>	N:N
"and the queerest thing about it is--that i heard it in gloucestershire, and that it is true--at least about the tailor, the waistcoat, and the ""no more twist!"" _christmas_ </br>"	N:N
they were of every fragrance and color. </br>	N:N
hans takes the goat, ties its legs, and puts it in his pocket. </br>	N:N
i have been accustomed to live in a family, and i cannot get used to this life. </br>	Sa:N
mr. jeremy put on a mackintosh, and a pair of shiny galoshes; he took his rod and basket, and set off with enormous hops to the place where he kept his boat. </br>	N:N
"i was the only one who rejoiced aloud in that castle,"" said the wind. </br>"	N:N
several of the guests could scarcely forbear laughing, and the sculptor would have had some difficulty in keeping his countenance, but the smile on his lips faded away; for he caught sight of a pair of dark-blue eyes close by the side of the inquisitive lady. </br>	N:H
(cottontail had married a black rabbit, and gone to live on the hill.) </br>	N:N
then he went on, and under the shadow of a large haystack he found a caterpillar crawling along. </br>	N:N
we shall have it very wet here presently. </br>	H:N
you prayed for him, but it was no good, he was to ride until his limbs were paralysed; but you stole down to him, as i steal now to you, you yourself put little stones under each of his feet that he might have support, nobody saw it, or they pretended not to see it, for you were then the young gracious mistress. </br>	Su+:N
who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring him milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? </br>	Sa:Su-
he had no reason for doing so, therefore it must have been the fault of the black goblin who lived in the snuff-box. </br>	N:N
there stood the old goblin from the dovre mountains, with his crown of hardened ice and polished fir-cones. </br>	N:N
and god pressed the dead child to his heart, and wings were given him so that he could fly with the angel, hand in hand. </br>	H:N
"you must not speak to me, said the garter; ""i do not think i have given you any encouragement to do so."" </br>"	D:N
the girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in her distress she jumped into the water after the spindle. </br>	F:Sa
"today i""ll brew, tomorrow bake; merrily i""ll dance and sing, for next day will a stranger bring. </br>"	H:H
how could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at last got? </br>	N:H
now, whether it was the goblin who did it, or the draught, is not known, but the window flew open, and out fell the tin soldier, heels over head, from the third story, into the street beneath. </br>	N:N
"however, i shall consider myself happy when some one comes to take me out of this place."" </br>"	N:N
and then he stayed in bed two hours longer. </br>	N:N
the great city where he resided was very gay; every day many strangers from all parts of the globe arrived. </br>	N:H
thou wilt not get into heaven. </br>	D:N
so she shook two dishes of peas into the ashes. </br>	N:N
"charming!
30:30	n:h	h:h	charming! echoed from every voice. </br>"	N:F
on the way into the forest hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground. </br>	N:N
all the will-o'-the-wisps are ordered to be there to hold a torch dance, as it is called. </br>	N:N
they got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs. </br>	N:N
then he scattered the dry leaves over the light earth with his foot, and went home through the darkness; but he went not alone, as he thought,- the little elf accompanied him. </br>	N:N
"so he is promoted, said the darning-needle, ""while i remain here; i am too fine, but that is my pride, and what do i care?"" </br>"	N:N
the children then danced about with their pretty toys, and no one noticed the tree, except the children's maid who came and peeped among the branches to see if an apple or a fig had been forgotten. </br>	H:N
delightful indeed, cried a voice quite near to them; no one but the tin soldier saw that it came from a rag of the leather which hung in tatters; it had lost all its gilding, and looked like wet earth, but it had an opinion, and it spoke it thus:- </br>	N:N
the princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the opposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising to come again the next night. </br>	N:N
there it stands, unsheltered, plundered, and broken. </br>	D:N
they looked so inviting that the children could not help stopping; and they remained there so long eating, that their mouths and cheeks became quite black with the juice. </br>	H:N
"i must go and see for myself."" </br>"	N:N
i think i should feel quite well if he only felt my pulse, said duchess, backing away from the magpie, who sidled up with something in his beak. </br>	N:N
the sausage had only to watch the pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered, and salted, and ready to be served. </br>	H:N
there was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of the earth. </br>	N:N
the poor volunteer came out of the last heart in the row quite bewildered. </br>	F:Su-
their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before. </br>	N:N
the princess sprang up, threw her arms round his neck, embraced and kissed him repeatedly, and took her stomacher, which was made of pure gold, and hung it round his neck. </br>	H:H
and now olaf hase arrives. </br>	N:N
"thou art poor and needy, bring thy child to me, i will take her with me and be her mother, and care for her."" </br>"	N:N
the soldier could not help kissing her, true soldier as he was. </br>	N:N
once upon a time there was little girl, pretty and dainty. </br>	N:N
as he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle but empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. </br>	N:N
"make me more porridge, please!"" </br>"	N:N
they ride the shortest way, through the waving reeds, where the wind moans sadly. </br>	N:N
not a single herdsman did we meet, not a solitary hut did we pass; everything appeared lonely and deserted- only a shooting star showed that in the heavens there was yet life. </br>	N:N
now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty servant, who was allowed to go everywhere. </br>	N:N
his comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted. </br>	H:N
the great oaks formed an outline to the scene which he so well remembered in his childhood. </br>	N:N
but when she wanted to go to the right, the shoes danced to the left, and when she wanted to dance up the room, the shoes danced down the room, down the stairs through the street, and out through the gates of the town. </br>	N:N
then the little elf flew in, and leaned his head on the delicate, fragrant walls. </br>	N:N
"the next was too short: ""what a dumpling!"" said she. </br>"	D:N
but now we will descend to east street, and see what happened to the watchman's body. </br>	N:N
the dog did not observe how the flour ran out of the bag all the way from the castle wall to the soldier's house, and even up to the window, where he had climbed with the princess. </br>	N:N
"these little wights have made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good turn if we can.
17:17	n:sa	h:s	i am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to keep off the cold.
18:18	n:n	n:n	ill tell you what, i will make each of them a shirt, and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and do you make each of them a little pair of shoes."" </br>"	H:H
it touched the tin soldier so much to see her that he almost wept tin tears, but he kept them back. </br>	H:H
and thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. </br>	H:N
then she felt for the little piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. </br>	Sa:N
"a pious, faithful soul closed her eyes for ever; she was the pastor's wife. ...""if any one shall find rest in the grave and mercy before our lord you shall certainly do so,"" said the pastor. </br>"	N:N
the paralysed girl sits in the warm sunshine and can see the wood and the lake; the world had become so large, so beautiful, and only through a single word from the kind mistress of the mansion. </br>	H:H
it entirely forgot how beautiful everything around it was, how warmly the sun was shining, and how splendidly white its own petals were. </br>	N:N
there was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter. </br>	N:N
"everything went right for a week or two, and then dame ilsabill said, ""husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; i should like to have a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him to give us a castle."" </br>"	D:N
and they thought they had done a very clever thing, but it was certain to turn out ill for them. </br>	N:N
"who knows, said she, ""from whence the creature who can""t speak, comes? </br>"	D:N
it was 'live and let live,' here. </br>	N:N
"the ash-heap said, ""then i will burn furiously,"" and began to burn in clear flames. </br>"	N:Su-
the butterfly came also to marguerite to inquire, but he did not pluck off her leaves; he pressed a kiss on each of them, for he thought there was always more to be done by kindness. </br>	H:N
he had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp. </br>	N:N
"she ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought: ""one of the wings is burning! </br>"	N:Su-
where indeed were they? </br>	N:N
but as the young ones were never boiled or laid in silver dishes, they concluded that the castle had fallen into decay, and that all the people in the world were dead; and as nobody contradicted them, they thought they must be right. </br>	N:N
then, if any of our friends act absurdly, no one need to be vexed about it. </br>	Su-:N
"well, said little marleen, ""i will go out too and see if the bird will give me anything."" </br>"	N:N
"half-done!
26:26	n:su-	n:-	what are you saying?
27:27	su-:su-	-:-	i never heard the name in my life, ill wager anything it is not in the calendar!"" </br>"	N:N
then she rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had thought her dead long since. </br>	H:H
he tried to build a lofty storey himself, but it fell to pieces, and he fell with it and broke his neck. </br>	N:N
"and one day when the shepherd and his wife were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ""i will shoot old sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now."" </br>"	N:N
there was no garden; the neighborhood of mr. piperson's was all scratched up by fowls. </br>	N:N
"but the untidiness was something dreadful--""never did i see such a mess--smears of honey; and moss, and thistledown--and marks of big and little dirty feet-- all over my nice clean house!"" </br>"	A:D
and the weather did change; it began to thaw. </br>	N:N
"to-morrow night i will watch by the child."" </br>"	N:N
there lies in the pond a little dead baby who has dreamed itself to death, said the mother. </br>	N:N
am i stupid? </br>	Su-:F
there he lay stretched on his bed, dead, with his old nightcap tightly clasped in his two hands. </br>	N:N
"speak low, that you may not awaken anybody."" </br>"	F:F
then the door opened, and the king walked in, and there stood a maiden more lovely than any he had ever seen. </br>	Su+:N
"the old steward of the castle, who has to watch there at night, sometimes comes in; but he carries a great bunch of keys, and as soon as the flowers hear the keys rattle, they run and hide themselves behind the long curtains, and stand quite still, just peeping their heads out.
27:27	d:n	n:n	then the old steward says, 'i smell flowers here,' but he cannot see them. </br>"	N:N
"you shall suffer for it!"" </br>"	A:A
but his buttonholes were the greatest triumph of it all. </br>	N:N
"kate!
3:3	n:n	n:n	i am going to work in the fields; when i come back i shall be hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale. </br>"	H:N
then he tried to pull his head back again, but without success; he could move his neck about easily enough, and that was all. </br>	N:N
"as he drew near, the raven said, ""i am by birth a king""s daughter, but am now under the spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free."" </br>"	N:H
"what happiness for a mother!"" </br>"	H:H
we dried her clothes as well as we were able, and remained on the water till they were dry; for we did not wish it to be known what a fright we had had, nor the danger which our little adopted sister had incurred, in whose life aphtanides had now a part. </br>	F:N
so on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all. </br>	H:H
you don't understand me, said the duckling. </br>	N:N
a happy death! </br>	H:H
and the coffin was set among the hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. </br>	Sa:N
when he had had enough, and the others also had quite emptied their dishes, he distinctly heard all the candles being suddenly snuffed out, and as it was now pitch dark, he felt something like a box on the ear. </br>	N:N
whir-r-r-r went all the wheels, running round, and then the music stopped. </br>	N:N
"you are the pipe-head, and i am the good head- snap! there you go!"" </br>"	N:N
and the hens and chickens came up on the dung-hill, and the cock strutted about like a lord. </br>	H:N
when the time came, the father and son went out together to the place agreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself and his father in the middle of it. </br>	N:N
grandmother says that she has heard her own grandmother tell of him; he is said to lead a solitary life, and to have nobody with whom he can converse save the great old church bell. </br>	Sa:N
"my husband, timmy tiptoes, has run away too."" </br>"	Sa:N
the sun shone brightly, and the church bells were ringing merrily as the people passed by, dressed in their best clothes, with their prayer-books under their arms. </br>	N:N
miss cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. </br>	N:N
and when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar. </br>	Su+:Su+
"now comes the exciting part, little anna.
77:77	n:n	n:n	this is the most important in all the play.
78:78	n:n	n:n	mr. waistcoat undoes himself, and addresses his speech to you, that you may applaud; but leave it alone,- that's considered more genteel.
79:79	n:n	n:n	'i am driven to extremities! </br>"	H:N
she related to them all that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go and try her fortune. </br>	H:N
in the morning snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her, and said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would take good care of her. </br>	Sa:Sa
now they were all beautiful, and all exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of sugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey; so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey. </br>	N:N
they lived with their mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir-tree. </br>	N:N
the glass with the foot of blue wood was the only thing that did not sink, for the wood floated and the glass drifted away to be cast upon the shore and broken; where and when, is indeed of no consequence. </br>	N:N
she had heard and yet not heard, as we are often obliged to do in this world, in order to live at peace; but she could not keep it from her neighbour on the other side any longer. </br>	N:N
but during the night, the first after the sister's death, while the brother was sleeping in his bed, close to where he had placed the fragrant jasmine, every flower cup opened, and invisibly the little spirits stole out, armed with poisonous spears. </br>	N:N
"i am the fishermans son."" </br>"	N:N
she was old and bent then; for fifty years had passed and she had outlived them all. </br>	N:N
"goodbye, mother."" </br>"	N:N
"so he said: ""take care, or i will hang you up again."" </br>"	A:A
"in the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the procession he said: ""for shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you running across the fields after this young man? </br>"	A:A
the empty pail was not too heavy for him; he slung it up wobbling over the head of tommy brock. </br>	N:N
and as he went he saw two asses in the court running about, and the salad lying on the ground. </br>	H:N
"i exclaimed, ""and what wonders you can relate?"" </br>"	Su+:N
do you see the farmhouse there, with the large baking stove, which projects like a gigantic egg out of the wall into the road? </br>	N:N
so she went out. </br>	N:N
he shall sing in the church, and stand among the beautiful gilded angels who are like him! </br>	H:N
"he found the tinder-box, but no sooner had he struck a few sparks from the flint and steel, than the door flew open and the dog with eyes as big as teacups, whom he had seen while down in the tree, stood before him, and said, ""what orders, master?"" </br>"	Su+:N
"one is not offered a beautiful princess and half a kingdom every day of ones life!"" </br>"	H:Su+
it seems as if the sunbeams were always looking for me under the water. </br>	N:N
"yes, answered he, ""so far, so good; but there are three things besides that i want to know: why a fountain which once flowed with wine has become dry, and no longer gives even water; why a tree which once bore golden apples does not even put forth leaves; and why a ferry-man must always be going backwards and forwards, and is never set free?"" </br>"	N:N
old mr. bouncer was stricken in years. </br>	N:N
all were in full dress, and every eye was turned to the little gray bird when the emperor nodded to her to begin. </br>	N:N
"then she knocked at the door, and cried, ""fine wares to sell!"" </br>"	N:N
they have flown off their stalks into the air, and flap their leaves as if they were little wings to make them fly. </br>	N:N
there was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the king faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer because of the many wounds which he had received. </br>	Sa:N
he was such a little wee thing, that no human eye could see him. </br>	N:N
"then the little man began to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with him to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, ""now, lady, what is my name?"" </br>"	H:H
"ah, i have cured him of staring, though; now he may hang up there, and shine, that i may see myself.
11:11	sa:n	n:n	if i only knew how to manage to move away from this place,- i should so like to move.
12:12	sa:n	s:n	if i could, i would slide along yonder on the ice, as i have seen the boys do; but i don't understand how; i don't even know how to run. </br>"	H:N
"the king said: ""that cannot be true! </br>"	A:Su-
the high walls and indented battlements were reflected in the water of the ditches, on which swans were swimming and peering into the old shady avenues. </br>	N:N
"ah, said the old woman, ""it is an innocent child who has lost himself in the forest, and out of pity i have let him come in; he has to take a letter to the queen."" </br>"	N:N
after a year or so had passed, the queen brought a son into the world. </br>	N:N
at length she took a cauldron, set it on the fire, and boiled yarn in it. </br>	N:N
the ducks pecked him, the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet. </br>	N:N
"jip!"" </br>"	N:N
"her second sister was soon after married, and when lily was asked to go to the wedding, she said to the prince, ""i will not go alone this time--you must go with me."" </br>"	N:N
when the kettle fell, tommy brock, who was still grinning, happened to be uppermost; and he rolled mr. tod over and over like a log, out at the door. </br>	N:H
and she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and danced and jumped about in them. </br>	H:H
the tailor, full of unwonted courage, jumped up, put his clothes on in haste, and hurried out. </br>	F:H
in front of the little window, an old bent bird-cage hung in the sunshine, which had not even a proper water-glass, but instead of it the broken neck of a bottle, turned upside down, and a cork stuck in to make it hold the water with which it was filled. </br>	N:N
sometimes it would be a man hanging on a gibbet and holding a heart in his hand as if he had been stealing hearts. </br>	N:N
she killed two fowls, scalded them, plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before the fire, that they might roast. </br>	N:N
but one day as the queen was walking by the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor little fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping and nearly dead on the bank. </br>	F:Sa
"she called to him, ""go away, we do not want thee!"" </br>"	D:N
so the good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave it to them for food. </br>	N:N
yes; one morning people came to clear out the garret, the boxes were packed away, and the tree was pulled out of the corner, and thrown roughly on the garret floor; then the servant dragged it out upon the staircase where the daylight shone. </br>	N:N
anne lisbeth walked on, thinking of nothing at all, as people say, or rather her thoughts wandered, but not away from her, for thought is never absent from us, it only slumbers. </br>	N:N
the witch placed herself on the shore, threw breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck; but the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to go home at night as she had come. </br>	A:N
they were two old ones from the nest and a little one of the family. </br>	N:N
beg and pray as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. </br>	A:Sa
thou, lady, art loveliest here, i ween; but lovelier far is the new-made queen. </br>	N:N
it is very unpleasant, i am afraid of the police, said pickles. </br>	F:F
so she turned round; and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely to cool herself. </br>	N:N
"it is thus granted to us.
39:39	n:n	n:n	by my side you will be able to fly wherever your thoughts wish to go.
40:40	n:n	n:f	invisible to men, we shall penetrate into their most secret chambers; but with sure hand you must find out him who is destined to eternal torture, and before the cock crows he must be found! </br>"	N:N
she skimmed along over the treetops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared. </br>	N:N
they were terrified and wanted to hide themselves. </br>	F:F
then he went his way, and in the evening came to the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty, and poor. </br>	N:N
"i will take care and stand behind the door."" </br>"	N:N
i may not wrong thee, nor will i do so. </br>	N:N
however, after a while he summoned up courage and went forward. </br>	F:F
it was ready however by saturday, when he went to see the princess. </br>	N:N
you should have seen me then, when i was turned down. </br>	N:N
mother holle led her, as she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing through, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came pouring over her. </br>	N:N
a little homely bed was prepared for him, but to him who had so often slept on the hard stones it was a royal couch, and he slept sweetly and dreamed of the splendid pictures and of the metal pig. </br>	H:H
and this at last angered her. </br>	A:A
"turn back, turn back, young maiden fair, linger not in this murderers lair."" </br>"	N:N
it was quite an event, and all the town knew of it, so that it was not necessary to announce it by beat of drum. </br>	N:N
perhaps we shall find out some day, but we don't know now. </br>	N:N
the little tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and threw it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. </br>	N:N
yes, they called him little tuk, but it was not his real name; he had called himself so before he could speak plainly, and he meant it for charles. </br>	N:N
it ordered him to turn round and look at the glass chest which was standing opposite. </br>	N:N
the faithful warriors will not leave him, but follow him out into the deep waters. </br>	N:N
but after a while i grew too big for them, and they sent me away to the housekeeper's room; so i came to live on the lower story. </br>	N:N
"said the peasants: ""are there any more there?"" </br>"	Su+:N
at last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse voice: </br>	N:N
behind each leaf of the rose he had a sleeping chamber. </br>	N:N
a month passed, and the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all the earth was green. </br>	N:N
the wild man turned back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest. </br>	N:N
in the same courtyard two of the merry children were playing who had danced round the tree at christmas, and had been so happy. </br>	H:N
miss moppet holds her poor head in her paws and looks at him through a hole in the duster. </br>	N:N
"i am making a little trough, answered the child, ""for father and mother to eat out of when i am big."" </br>"	Sa:N
on the grave, close by the churchyard wall, they planted a rose-tree; it was soon full of roses, and the nightingale sat among the flowers, and sang over the grave. </br>	N:N
the brassy knobs on the railings shone more brightly than ever, as if they had been polished on account of his visit; and on the door were carved trumpeters standing in tulips, and it seemed as if they were blowing with all their might, their cheeks were so puffed out. </br>	N:N
then chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland from the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then the bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to the river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to partlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay quite dead, and never moved any more. </br>	N:N
"cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!"" </br>"	N:N
soon afterwards the robbers came, and angrily asked what strange boy was lying there? </br>	A:A
the youth drew out the axe and let him go. </br>	Su+:N
then they came and rolled the barrel towards the water. </br>	N:N
"when it was boiled, she flung it on the poor girl""s shoulder, and gave her an axe in order that she might go on the frozen river, cut a hole in the ice, and rinse the yarn. </br>"	N:N
"when he got near the battlefield a great part of the king""s men had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give way. </br>"	Sa:N
very soon a third leaf made its appearance. </br>	N:N
after a time there was another feast, and cat-skin asked the cook to let her go up and see it as before. </br>	N:N
and why am i to go in this paper frock? </br>	Su-:N
what an unlucky wretch i am! cried he. </br>	A:Su-
i knew he would bring me some shells from the gulf of lepanto, or perhaps a knife with a shining blade. </br>	N:N
quickly he passed into another heart, which had the appearance of a spacious, holy church, with the white dove of innocence fluttering over the altar. </br>	N:N
the lord was willing, and let both of them have a seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. </br>	N:N
they walked along the high-road, where once they had driven in their splendid carriage; they went forth with their father as beggars. </br>	N:N
"five hens, it now ran, ""have plucked out all their feathers to show which of them had grown leanest for love of the cock, and then they all pecked at each other till the blood ran down and they fell down dead, to the derision and shame of their family, and to the great loss of their owner."" </br>"	N:N
"then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and when she opened her eyes he said: ""you are mine, and i am yours, and no one in the world can alter that."" </br>"	H:H
"the miller said: ""the devil must go out,"" and opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys, and the peasant unlocked the closet. </br>"	F:N
"it is only a hundred man-steps from here."" </br>"	N:N
"the grocer ran his finger down the advertisement column of his newspaper--""lost, stolen or strayed, 10s. reward;"" he looked suspiciously at pig-wig. </br>"	N:A
the bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the stone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took the stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the tree and sang-- </br>	N:N
and young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the sugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak. </br>	H:H
life and limb were lost in the battle. </br>	N:N
a white cat was staring at some goldfish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. </br>	N:N
are you a fellow of that sort? said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. </br>	H:N
it was built of red brick, with projecting gables. </br>	N:N
there was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. </br>	N:N
that was a good roll, and proved the summons to victory for the men, who had already begun to give way. </br>	N:N

the dog never went out in winter, unless she was attired in a little lambskin coat which had been made for her; it was fastened round the little dog's neck and body with red ribbons, and was decorated with rosettes and little bells. </br>	N:N
in the royal city of bavaria, many years after the bell had been removed from the tower and melted down, some metal was required for a monument in honor of one of the most celebrated characters which a german people or a german land could produce. </br>	N:N

they were even lighter and more delicate than the flowers from which they were born; and as the flames were extinguished, and nothing remained of the paper but black ashes, these little beings danced upon it; and whenever they touched it, bright red sparks appeared. </br>	N:N
"when the old woman heard that, she became quite friendly, and carried her over the water, gave her a wand, and said to her, ""go, my daughter, ever onwards by this road, and when you come to a great black dog, you must pass it silently and boldly, without either laughing or looking at it. </br>"	N:H

"on many a warm summer, the ephemera, the flies that exist for only a day, had fluttered about the old oak, enjoyed life and felt happy and if, for a moment, one of the tiny creatures rested on one of his large fresh leaves, the tree would always say, ""poor little creature! your whole life consists only of a single day. </br>"	N:H
they did not see him. </br>	N:N
when he arose in the morning, all the work was already done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the fire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon, when he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. </br>	Su+:N

sure enough, there he lay on an upper shelf of a vapor bath, still in his evening costume, with his boots and goloshes on, and the hot drops from the ceiling falling on his face. </br>	N:N
the farmer's wife and the sexton were sitting at the table together; and she filled his glass, and helped him plenteously to fish, which appeared to be his favorite dish. </br>	H:N

when little claus reached home again, he immediately sent a boy to great claus, requesting him to lend him a bushel measure. </br>	N:N
alas! </br>	Sa:N
therefore he immediately set his foot into the mud and mire of the street, which in those days possessed no pavement. </br>	N:N
that seems very poor consolation, said one of the plants in the room, that grew in a pot. </br>	N:Sa
the goblin laid the tongue upon the cask, in which lay a quantity of old newspapers. </br>	N:N
he sent a messenger to the other bride, and entreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he had a wife already, and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new one. </br>	N:N
it was winter, and the windows were quite frozen, so the little boy was obliged to breathe on the panes, and rub a hole to peep through at the old house. </br>	N:N
do you see that pouter pigeon? said one to the other. </br>	D:N

her delicate fingers danced over the keys, and made them ring into peter's heart. </br>	N:N
the water-drops spurted up among the green twigs, and the clerk thought of the millions of animalculae which were thrown into the air with every drop of water, at a height which must be the same to them as it would be to us if we were hurled beyond the clouds. </br>	N:N

mamma-in-law had set up thorwalsden's bust at the end of the table, attired in a dressing-gown; it was her fancy that he should be a guest. </br>	N:N

umbrellas, sticks, and hats swung in the net before him, and almost obstructed the prospect, which was really very imposing; and as he glanced at it, his memory recalled the words of one poet at least, who has sung of switzerland, and whose poems have not yet been printed:- </br>	N:N

no one was in the street but himself; it belonged only to him, so he boldly seated himself on the pig's back, leaned forward so that his curly head could rest on the head of the animal, and, before he was aware, he fell asleep. </br>	N:N
then she went upstairs in the form of the queen, nursed the baby, shook up its little bed, covered it over, and then swam away again down the gutter in the shape of a duck. </br>	N:N

it must be a kind of garden plant, said another; and so they sneered and despised the plant as a thing from a garden. </br>	D:D
the same thing happened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be cut off. </br>	N:N
"then she gave her a little piece of hard bread, and said, ""this will last thee the day,"" and thought, ""thou wilt die of cold and hunger outside, and wilt never be seen again by me."" </br>"	D:N
the storm would not leave this little sentry-house alone, but must needs tear it from its fastenings, and roll it down the street; and, wonderfully enough, it stopped opposite to the door of the dirty journeyman plasterer, who had saved three lives at the last fire, but the sentry-house thought nothing of that. </br>	N:N
what a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen! </br>	N:N
i should think not, replied the scissors. </br>	N:N
old mr. bouncer, very sulky, was huddled up in a corner, barricaded with a chair. </br>	N:A

she ties him up in the duster and tosses it about like a ball. </br>	N:N
the little elder-tree mother had suddenly become a charming young girl, but her dress was still of the same green material, covered with white blossoms, as the elder-tree mother had worn; she had a real elder blossom on her bosom, and a wreath of the same flowers was wound round her curly golden hair; her eyes were so large and so blue that it was wonderful to look at them. </br>	N:N
in this street, just in front of the market-place where vegetables are sold, stands a pig, made of brass and curiously formed. </br>	N:N

winter came, and the plant was covered with snow, but the snow glittered over it as if it had sunshine beneath as well as above. </br>	N:N
the church itself had come to the poor girl in her narrow room, or the room had gone to the church. </br>	N:N

one bitter cold day near christmastime the tailor began to make a coat (a coat of cherry- coloured corded silk embroidered with pansies and roses) and a cream- coloured satin waistcoat for the mayor of gloucester. </br>	N:N

the cook, however, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it, and was about to drink it up. </br>	F:Su-

this seems funny, said tom kitten. </br>	N:N
you're a pretty fellow, said the soldier, seizing him, and placing him on the witch's apron, while he filled his pockets from the chest with as many pieces as they would hold. </br>	N:N
hold fast! hold fast! the spectre would cry; and as anne lisbeth murmured these words to herself, the whole of her dream was suddenly recalled to her memory, when the mother had clung to her, and uttered these words, when, amid the crashing of worlds, her sleeve had been torn, and she had slipped from the grasp of her child, who wanted to hold her up in that terrible hour. </br>	N:F

then, if they behave well, they obtain permission to fly about during the day, instead of being obliged to sit still on their stems at home, and so in time their leaves become real wings. </br>	N:N

at length, therefore, three tailors fell in with each other, the two eldest of whom thought they had done so many dexterous bits of work successfully that they could not fail to succeed in this also; the third was a little useless land-louper, who did not even know his trade, but thought he must have some luck in this venture, for where else was it to come from? </br>	N:N
here's a cooking utensil with a tin handle. </br>	N:N
it bloomed only once in five years, and then it had only one single rose upon it, but what a rose! </br>	N:N

then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly offered to help poor chanticleer by laying himself across the stream; and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and managed to get partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners, who were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water and were all carried away by the stream and drowned. </br>	Sa:N

very shortly, a fine new house was built farther back from the road; it had lofty windows and smooth walls, but in front, on the spot where the old house really stood, a little garden was planted, and wild vines grew up over the neighboring walls; in front of the garden were large iron railings and a great gate, which looked very stately. </br>	N:N

"he was appointed ""bellringer to the world,"" and wrote every year a short dissertation on the owl, but by this means people did not become any wiser than they had been before. </br>"	N:N
and as he thus sat, his eyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. </br>	N:N
and the little boy looked at the teapot; the lid rose up gradually, the elder-tree blossoms sprang forth one by one, fresh and white; long boughs came forth; even out of the spout they grew up in all directions, and formed a bush- nay, a large elder tree, which stretched its branches up to the bed and pushed the curtains aside; and there were so many blossoms and such a sweet fragrance! </br>	N:N
you're the ugliest thing i've seen for one while. </br>	D:N
and i will own, that when people saw my father perched up in front of the omnibus of death, dressed in his long, wide, black cloak, and his black-edged, three-cornered hat on his head, and then glanced at his round, jocund face, round as the sun, they could not think much of sorrow or the grave. </br>	N:N
but at parting the little girl took an elder-blossom from her breast and gave it to him as a keepsake. </br>	N:N

the king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had his little cap on his head. </br>	N:N
but the mate did not see the bottle: indeed, if he had he would not have known it, or supposed it was the one out of which they had drunk to the felicity of the betrothed and to the prospect of a marriage on his own happy return. </br>	N:N
then the girl told her father all that had happened. </br>	N:N
so they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap and fell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from his shoulders, hung it on her own, picked up the diamonds, and wished herself home again. </br>	H:N
