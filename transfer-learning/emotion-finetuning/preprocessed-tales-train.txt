upon this there was a great uproar; even the engravings, which hung in frames on the wall, turned round in their excitement, and showed that they had a wrong side to them, although they had not the least intention to expose themselves in this way, or to object to the game. </br>	H:N
she sunk down, and the spectre covered her with a black cloak; night closed around her, the night of death. </br>	N:N
she told them about the poor flowers which were dead; and as soon as they obtained permission, they went with her to bury them. </br>	N:N
trees and bushes were covered with hoar frost, and looked like a forest of white coral; while on every twig glittered frozen dew-drops. </br>	N:N
the huntsman took notice of it all, and went to the king and told him what he had seen and heard. </br>	N:N
never did any pigs run as these pigs ran! </br>	N:N
the pail got fuller and fuller, and swung like a pendulum. </br>	N:N
a grave! dig me a grave! still sounded in her ears; she was fearful that the cock might crow, and the first red streak appear in the east, before she had finished her work; and then she would be lost. </br>	F:F
"for a long time it was uncertain which of the two would gain the victory; at length the stag thrust his horns into his adversary""s body, whereupon the bull fell to the earth with a terrific roar, and was thoroughly despatched by a few strokes from the stag. </br>"	N:N
where is the goat, hans? </br>	N:N
and the matches glowed with a light that was brighter than the noon-day, and her grandmother had never appeared so large or so beautiful. </br>	H:N
"everyone made way for her, for nobody knew her, and they thought she could be no less than a king""s daughter. </br>"	Su+:N
next morning the king came to inquire after him. </br>	N:N
after they had traveled about for a long time, they came to a town in which was a beautiful but proud princess, who had caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever should set her a riddle which she could not guess, that man should be her husband; but if she guessed it, his head must be cut off. </br>	N:N
"but he said, ""money, i will not have, i have enough of it."" </br>"	N:N
the miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of his money. </br>	A:N
in winter no ships sail by, for the whole sound is covered with ice as far as the swedish coast, and has quite the appearance of a high-road. </br>	N:N
"when they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, ""one of you shall marry her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be."" </br>"	H:H
her old sweetheart is dead and has left a wife and three step-children, as the paper says; it sounds as if there is a crack, but the metal is pure. </br>	Sa:N
the poor swineherd took these words to heart, for they were addressed to him; he knew not that there were others who were equally ignorant. </br>	Sa:Sa
he opened his mouth most unnecessarily wide; he certainly had not a tooth in his head. </br>	N:N
she used to lose her kittens continually, and whenever they were lost they were always in mischief! </br>	N:N
then they tore of her dainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into pieces, and sprinkled salt upon it. </br>	N:N
where? where? cooed the doves. </br>	Su-:N
what is it that you are always muttering between your teeth? </br>	A:N
"then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had not seen it, but the south wind said, ""i have seen the white dove--he has fled to the red sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the seven years are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon; and the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from you."" </br>"	N:F
"and again the princess was compelled to do servant""s work until cock-crow. </br>"	F:N
"the huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, ""if all this does happen, it will be a fine thing for me."" </br>"	H:H
"he again said: ""i may not, i have a sore head."" </br>"	F:N
i could have expressed that better, thought the critic; but he did not say it aloud, which for him was something, after all. </br>	N:N
and so it happened that the butterfly got no wife at all. </br>	N:N
the miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in the air. </br>	A:N
mr. brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts? </br>	N:N
and chanticleer replied, </br>	N:N
father-stork was making a speech to his family, and his family was glancing down at the two young men in the kitchen garden. </br>	N:N
they said lady halle was beautiful, but her beauty was that of a tempting fiend. </br>	N:N
certainly it was a very good house to look at for amusement. </br>	H:N
where does he dwell now? </br>	Sa:N
thou art the husband chosen for me by heaven, and shalt pass thy life in unbroken joy, loved by me, and rich to overflowing in every earthly possession. </br>	H:N
"that is not a fault, said the music-master, ""it is quite perfect to my taste,"" so then it had to sing alone, and was as successful as the real bird; besides, it was so much prettier to look at, for it sparkled like bracelets and breast-pins. </br>"	N:N
now the very day before his creditors were to take his house from him, came the lord and st. peter, and asked him to give them shelter for the night. </br>	N:N
"oh, said the mother, ""that is not a turkey; how well he uses his legs, and how upright he holds himself! </br>"	Su+:N
good day, mother, said the boy. </br>	N:N
he had a gold crown on his head, and delicate wings at his shoulders, and was not much larger than tiny herself. </br>	N:N
this made the woman angry, and she scolded him and threatened him, which made him very unhappy, and he went and sat in his own room full of sad thoughts. </br>	A:Sa
who is your father? </br>	N:N
"it is surprising that we have never heard this before; she will be a great success at court."" </br>"	Su+:N
"the miller""s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: ""lay yourself on the straw there,"" and gave him a slice of bread and cheese. </br>"	N:N
"perhaps this was the one who sang to me so sweetly in the summer, she said; ""and how much pleasure it gave me, you dear, pretty bird."" </br>"	H:H
and not only to the ear of superstition is the sighing and the tread of hurrying feet audible in the long echoing passages leading to the convent door that has long been locked. </br>	N:N
mr. tod fetched a large heavy pailful of water from the spring, and staggered with it through the kitchen into his bedroom. </br>	N:N
gretel presents hans with a young goat. </br>	H:N
"in doing this, he saw afar off something bright and shining and calling to his companions said, ""there must be a house no great way off, for i see a light."" </br>"	Su+:Su+
"the king""s son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks. </br>"	F:Su-
when the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the bedroom to fetch fundevogel and throw him into it. </br>	N:N
then he looked round and saw a great bed in the corner. </br>	H:N
one day she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. </br>	N:N
he saw the knights of olden times and noble ladies ride by through the wood on their gallant steeds, with plumes waving in their hats, and falcons on their wrists. </br>	N:N
"the wind roared around it, and could have readily related the story of its origin and of its sweet chimes, and the wind could also tell of him to whom he had brought fresh air when, in the woods of a neighboring country, he had sunk down exhausted with fatigue, with no other worldly possessions than hope for the future, and a written leaf from ""fiesco."" </br>"	N:N
on his return home, he became a master builder,- built one house after another in the town, till they formed quite a street, which, when finished, became really an ornament to the town. </br>	N:N
and the old attendant nodded and looked very pleased, and then he carried the tin soldier into the house. </br>	H:H
and the flea went into foreign military service, where it is said he was killed. </br>	N:N
and now she knew no rest until she had learnt where the king kept the ball of yarn, and then she made little shirts of white silk, and as she had learnt the art of witchcraft from her mother, she sewed a charm inside them. </br>	N:N
he took up little thumbling carefully with two fingers, examined him, and without saying one word went away with him. </br>	N:N
"they walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father""s house. </br>"	N:H
the flames rushed out towards me, flickered on the window, and rose high above the roof. </br>	Sa:N
"at last she came to mother holle""s house, and as she had heard all about the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged herself without delay to the old woman. </br>"	H:N
because you are fond of fairytales, and have been ill, i have made you a story all for yourself--a new one that nobody has read before. </br>	N:N
with a number of courtiers, including the two who had already been there, he went to the two clever swindlers, who now worked as hard as they could, but without using any thread. </br>	N:N
the soldier longed very much to see the princess once more, so he sent for the dog again in the night to fetch her, and to run with her as fast as ever he could. </br>	N:Sa
in our time, it would be only a journey of a few hours, but then it took more than a day and a night to travel so far eastward from eisenbach to a town still called weimar, on the borders of thuringia. </br>	N:N
then he heard a roaring sound quite terrible enough to frighten the bravest man. </br>	N:N
can children go to these balls? </br>	N:N
just then came a hunter with four dogs. </br>	F:N
she finished a second plate, got up, and looked about her, as though she were going to start. </br>	N:N
i shall send my honest old minister to the weavers, thought the emperor. </br>	N:N
it was late in the evening when we reached my mother's door. </br>	N:N
"who has eaten from my little plate?
26:26	a:n	f:a	and who has been drinking out of my little glass? </br>"	A:N
oh dear, what was that? she exclaimed, as something pricked her. </br>	Su-:N
"yes, yes, said the others: ""if he will sing again, he can have it."" </br>"	N:N
and now the folding doors were thrown open, and a troop of children rushed in as if they intended to upset the tree; they were followed more silently by their elders. </br>	N:N
"the barber's shield, the great brazen dish, was carried away, and hurled straight into the embrasure of the councillor of justice; and the whole neighborhood said this looked almost like malice, inasmuch as they, and nearly all the friends of the councillor's wife, used to call that lady ""the razor"" for she was so sharp that she knew more about other people's business than they knew about it themselves. </br>"	N:N
so she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon her like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single apple left upon it. </br>	N:N
"we have seen the portraits of our great-grandfathers dressed in this way; but the ""pepper gentlemen"" had no money to spare to have their portraits taken, though one of them would have made a very interesting picture for us now, if taken as he appeared standing behind his counter, or going to church, or on holidays. </br>"	N:N
alas, wife! why should you wish to be emperor? said the fisherman. </br>	Sa:N
this was his most hopeful thought, though it often came to nothing. </br>	N:N
"from my father i received the best inheritance, namely a ""good temper."" </br>"	N:N
"i should not have done so?"" </br>"	N:N
baa! </br>	Su-:N
that's funny! said the magician. </br>	H:Su+
"the silk dresses rustled, the leather repeated its rhyme, and the old chairs had the gout in their backs, and cried, ""creak;"" it was all exactly like the first time; for in that house, one day and one hour were just like another. </br>"	N:N
"peep! said the sparrows, ""it's nothing. </br>"	Su-:N
he went into the kitchen, lighted the fire and boiled the kettle; for the moment he did not trouble himself to cook the baby rabbits. </br>	N:N
first he squeezed into the pantry. </br>	N:N
when the sun rose again and everything looked as refreshed as if it had had a quiet sleep, there only remained of the farmhouse a few black charred beams leaning against the chimney, which was now its own master. </br>	N:N
when the princess with her ladies passed by and heard the tune, she stopped and looked quite pleased, for she also could play it- in fact, it was the only tune she could play, and she played it with one finger. </br>	H:H
"what a buzzing and a rumbling there is in the elfin hill, said one of the lizards; ""i have not been able to close my eyes for two nights on account of the noise; i might just as well have had the toothache, for that always keeps me awake."" </br>"	A:A
a golden treasure had been hidden in the heart and soul of the poor child, who had beaten the roll as a drummer- a roll of victory for those who had been ready to retreat. </br>	N:N
"what dangerous walking it is, said he, ""in this ploughed field! </br>"	Su-:F
it made little tiny very sad to see it, she did so love the little birds; all the summer they had sung and twittered for her so beautifully. </br>	Sa:Sa
"it thought of its fresh youth in the forest, of the merry christmas evening, and of the little mice who had listened to the story of ""humpty dumpty."" </br>"	N:N
then a light broke in on her mind, and her heart expanded. </br>	H:H
that is the story, and whoever does not understand it may go and purchase a share in the tan-yard from the window. </br>	N:N
the little mice only laughed, and tried another tune-- </br>	H:H
in an old apron she carried a number of matches, and had a bundle of them in her hands. </br>	N:N
if even a tiny spark had remained it might set fire to something, and cause great damage. </br>	F:N
as the old man related this story, he was carving an image in wood to represent holger danske, to be fastened to the prow of a ship; for the old grandfather was a carver in wood, that is, one who carved figures for the heads of ships, according to the names given to them. </br>	N:N
there were little bells round the rim, and when the water began to boil in it, the bells began to play the old tune: </br>	N:N
the black earth- the dark grave- was the best thing for him now. </br>	N:N
but he warned them not to be alarmed at the sight of a dead bird which lay in the passage. </br>	N:N
the cat runs quickly up the stair, and lets her tail fly here and there, until she comes to the parlour door. </br>	N:N
"so he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair, when on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ""you see now what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. </br>"	Sa:Sa
so death gave up each of these treasures for a song; and the nightingale continued her singing. </br>	N:N
"the peasant answered: ""in the first place, he says that there is some wine hidden under the pillow."" </br>"	N:N
will you each remember to say, whatever may happen, 'my brother is a part of myself; his secret is my secret, my happiness is his; self-sacrifice, patience, everything belongs to me as they do to him?' </br>	N:N
"heaven preserve us! cried the apothecary, ""you are out of your mind. </br>"	Su-:N
it could not be more pleasant anywhere. </br>	N:N
then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven, chirping and hopping about. </br>	N:N
i'll pluck them, piped the young sparrow, who had no feathers yet. </br>	N:N
"i am travelling on a secret embassy, but you must not ask me any questions, for i cannot betray my secret."" </br>"	N:N
hansel stooped and stuffed the little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. </br>	N:N
you have devoured all when you were standing godmother. </br>	N:Sa
the mist was cold and damp, her hands and face were moist and clammy with horror, a heavy weight again seized her and clung to her, her mind became clear for thoughts that had never before been there. </br>	N:F
he will have nothing now but the grave. </br>	N:N
"what a lucky thing, said she, ""that we kept that meal! we have now a good use for it."" </br>"	H:H
how pretty she was! and such a singer! not a theatre singer, nor a ballad singer; no, but a singer of the woods; for she wandered through the gay green forest, and had a concert there for her own amusement. </br>	H:H
he broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and carried the duckling home to his wife. </br>	N:N
and so she went boldly on; but she had not got farther than the churchyard gate when she saw the red shoes dancing along before her. </br>	N:N
she had to be nursed and waited upon, and this was no one's duty more than karen's. </br>	N:N
she sung of the quiet churchyard, where the white roses grow, where the elder-tree wafts its perfume on the breeze, and the fresh, sweet grass is moistened by the mourners' tears. </br>	N:N
and after some days he united himself to her. </br>	N:N
then the king had the cook called before him and scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his service; and that he was to send him away at once. </br>	A:A
he looked at the small remains of a flitch [side of bacon], and then looked undecidedly at pigling. </br>	N:N
"then they said, ""yes, miss cat-skin, you will do for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that sort."" </br>"	N:N
so they ate, and after that they bargained how much the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on three hundred talers. </br>	N:N
"his collection of pictures increased; but as yet they were only copies of lifeless objects, when one day bellissima came gambolling before him: ""stand still,"" cried he, ""and i will draw you beautifully, to put amongst my collection."" </br>"	H:N
a large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it became higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. </br>	N:N
shall i run for the doctor? </br>	N:N
"no, replied the tree; ""it will certainly last much longer,- infinitely longer than i can even think of. </br>"	N:N
"ah! said the young man, ""that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?"" </br>"	H:H
her black hair was fastened into a knot, and confined by a headdress formed of gold and silver coins which had been found in an ancient temple. </br>	N:N
mr. mcgregor caught sight of him at the corner, but peter did not care. </br>	N:N
the flowers were at a ball last night, and therefore, it is no wonder they hang their heads. </br>	N:N
the smaller of the two represented a little boy sitting at a table, drawing; before him was a little white poodle, curiously shaven; but as the animal would not stand still, it had been fastened with a string to its head and tail, to keep it in one position. </br>	N:N
here dwells no fairy whose pearl could be counted amongst the best gifts of life. </br>	N:N
and the sword leaps from the scabbard, and olaf hase deals a blow that makes the panel of the church door, which jens glob hastily closes between them, fly in fragments. </br>	N:N
"soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ""now, my good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way when i want to taste one of the old shepherd""s fine fat sheep."" </br>"	N:N
she walked the whole night long, and next day also without stopping, until she could go no farther for weariness. </br>	N:N
then there was much rejoicing, and the little swallow who sat above them, in his nest, was asked to sing a wedding song, which he did as well as he could; but in his heart he felt sad for he was very fond of tiny, and would have liked never to part from her again. </br>	Sa:H
"the others laughed, and said: ""seek one for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the stable for you."" </br>"	Su-:N
he sprung out of bed and went to the window. </br>	N:N
"ah, really he must be very happy; i cannot endure this life."" </br>"	Sa:N
"anthony also said, ""farewell."" </br>"	Sa:N
"do you stay behind, said the woodman, ""and when i have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the scythe."" </br>"	F:N
i wish to goodness my head was through, said he, and instantly, though it was so thick and large, it slipped through quite easily. </br>	N:N
"he climbed up the tower before you did."" </br>"	F:N
"the young man answered considerately, as if the question had been a different one, ""no; he does not come from a great family."" </br>"	N:N
they lived on this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall, and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. </br>	Sa:N
inferior, indeed! said the buckwheat. </br>	A:A
the portuguese did not listen to him, but began eating as fast as she could, and made a good meal. </br>	N:N
i see no reason, young sir; your paper is all right. </br>	N:N
then take him to bed, said she to the cats. </br>	N:N
such tears as these cannot be washed out, even when the nightcap is forgotten. </br>	N:N
"next morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter""s shoe. </br>"	F:N
never emperor's clothes were more admired. </br>	N:N
"yes, to be sure he can.

53:53	h:h	h:h	it was saying, 'you are so pretty, i like you very much.'
54:54	a:a	n:a	but the professor did not approve of such nonsense, so he clapped his hands on the nettle to stop it.
55:55	a:n	a:s	then the leaves, which are its fingers, stung him so sharply that he has never ventured to touch a nettle since. </br>"	N:N
"where did you get this singular sheet?
91:91	n:n	h:n	it is very interesting, although the whole affair is a fable.
92:92	n:n	n:n	meteors are easily explained in these days; they are northern lights, which are often seen, and are no doubt caused by electricity. </br>"	H:N
all this was very sad for the poor little duckling. </br>	Sa:Sa
she threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. </br>	A:N
then he bought for the first two the fine clothes and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he got home he gave it to his daughter. </br>	N:N
"it happened that soon afterwards the king came into the village, and no one knew that he was the king, and when he asked the people what news there was, they answered, ""a child has just been born with a caul on; whatever any one so born undertakes turns out well. </br>"	N:N
he called out that it was morning--sunrise; and that the jays were making a noise down below in the woods. </br>	N:N
during the night, the dog came again and carried the princess on his back, and ran with her to the soldier, who loved her very much, and wished that he had been a prince, so that he might have her for a wife. </br>	N:H
"gretel presents hans with a needle, hans says: ""goodbye, gretel."" </br>"	N:N
in the midst of the tree sat a kindly-looking old woman with a strange dress; it was as green as the leaves, and trimmed with large white blossoms, so that it was difficult to say whether it was real cloth, or the leaves and blossoms of the elder-tree. </br>	Su+:N
peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself. </br>	Sa:Sa
it knew that it should never again see its dear old companions, the trees, nor the little bushes and many-colored flowers that had grown by its side; perhaps not even the birds. </br>	Sa:N
the legend says that every night, at twelve o'clock, he drove into his castleyard and out again. </br>	N:N
one day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no great comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like to be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking, black dwarf. </br>	Su-:Sa
"it is a splendid thing to have thy liberty."" </br>"	H:N
"send him to me, and i will soon polish him."" </br>"	N:N
but they were not talking of the moon, but of a large, old stone that lay below in the courtyard not very far from the kitchen door. </br>	N:N
i was, as i have said, a boy, and only stood by and listened to what the others said; but it filled me with a strange emotion to listen to the old man, and to watch how the color rose in his cheeks as he spoke of the days of their courtship, of how beautiful she was, and how many little tricks he had been guilty of, that he might meet her. </br>	Su-:Sa
there was once a little boy who had caught cold; he had gone out and got wet feet. </br>	N:N
so saying, she made a bite at the little singing-bird's head, and he fell dead on the ground. </br>	A:N
when darkness came on, he saw a light, which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. </br>	N:N
i am also the soldier that overset your stall. </br>	H:N
which way? </br>	F:N
"a great big enormous trout came up--ker-pflop-p-p-p! with a splash-- and it seized mr. jeremy with a snap, ""ow! </br>"	Su-:N
he spoke of farming, but what he said could scarcely be heard for the coughing and gasping of his neighbor. </br>	N:N
she bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns. </br>	N:N
"it is so early in the day that i shall still get there in good time""; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. </br>"	N:H
i will keep this, said she; and as soon as she had covered the body again with the earth and leaves, she took the head and a little sprig of jasmine that bloomed in the wood, near the spot where he was buried, and carried them home with her. </br>	Sa:N
and the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy. </br>	F:F
i know that i have a clever head; and what more do i want? </br>	N:N
and then he dug again and found some nuts that did not belong to him; and there was a fight. </br>	N:N
"then she said once again, ""art thou certain that thou hast not done it?"" </br>"	A:N
is it tom? </br>	N:N
then away he went. </br>	N:N
now that is all passed too. </br>	N:N
but she did not recognize the bottle, neither did the bottle notice the old maid. </br>	N:N
she rejoiced much to see them again, and carried them all over the water, and then she too went away, for now she was freed. </br>	H:H
and he kept his word, and became a critic. </br>	N:N
she had dropped one little straw out of her straw bed, when she set it on fire to save the lives of so many. </br>	N:N
but only for one day, and then it is all over. </br>	N:N
she turned in the direction of the church, and the weight on her heart seemed to grow lighter, and even to vanish altogether; but when she turned to go home by the shortest way, it returned. </br>	N:F
i am not stupid, said the man. </br>	D:N
it could not move one of its leaves, but the fragrance of its delicate petals streamed forth, and was much stronger than such flowers usually have: the bird noticed it, although it was dying with thirst, and in its pain tore up the green blades of grass, but did not touch the flower. </br>	N:N
but he distrusted peter thomas. </br>	N:F
fresh roses were scattered over her. </br>	N:N
not only the rapidity with which advance is made, but every other quality should have due consideration; as, for instance, how much weight a candidate is able to draw; but i have not brought this quality forward now, nor the sagacity of the hare in his flight, nor the cunning with which he suddenly springs aside and doubles, to lead people on a false track, thinking he has concealed himself. </br>	N:N
"but now, if i have been lying the whole winter in the moor, said the swallow, ""and suppose i slept the whole time, would that be taken into account?"" </br>"	N:N
"they are always saying: it makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!"" </br>"	N:N
"i should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself."" </br>"	N:N
still, it is very interesting to hear grandfather tell about it. </br>	N:N
enjoy thine own bright life in the fresh air. </br>	H:N

who is there? </br>	N:N
it described these spectacles as possessing a wonderful power; if any one put them on in a large assembly the people appeared like cards, and the future events of ensuing years could be easily foretold by them. </br>	N:N
timmy tiptoes went on with his work without replying; indeed, the little bird did not expect an answer. </br>	N:N
they caught him and dragged him up the very same tree, where there was the little round hole, and they pushed him in. </br>	N:N
then he jumped back into the water. </br>	N:N
she soon understood, however, that he did not find himself quite well, and therefore brought him a mug of water. </br>	N:N
in the spring; they began to pull the house itself down; people called it complete rubbish. </br>	N:N
where do the beautiful flowers dance? asked little ida. </br>	N:N
later in the day the two sparrows who had been born there came by. </br>	N:N
at last mr. tod's preparations were complete. </br>	N:N
the organ pealed forth solemnly, and the sweet children's voices mingled with that of their old leader; but karen thought only of her red shoes. </br>	N:N
sweet-tooth, his neighbor, dipped himself into sweet or sour, pointed to the sun and moon, and formed the letters when the fingers wrote. </br>	N:N
but neither the lieutenant nor any one in the street could recognize them as their own, so he gave them up to the police. </br>	N:N
the florentine, angiolo bronzino, painted this picture; most beautiful is the expression on the face of the two children, who appear to have full confidence that they shall reach heaven at last. </br>	H:N
they came out of the back parlor. </br>	N:N
"put in a stone, said great claus, ""or i may not sink."" </br>"	N:N
first, he was wrapped, in a vine-leaf, and put into a warm trousers' pocket. </br>	N:N
sometimes they pop me in a day extra; but i trouble myself very little about that. </br>	N:N
so he crept into a large sack, which had been lying across the back of one of the oxen. </br>	N:N
there lived once a great queen, in whose garden were found at all seasons the most splendid flowers, and from every land in the world. </br>	N:N
so ought we to do, if we wish to succeed at last.' </br>	N:N
then mrs. tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for lucie. </br>	N:N
she wanted to cry out, but she could bring forth no sound. </br>	Sa:Sa
"this is the coat! and ""here is the cloak!"" and so on. </br>"	H:N
oh, what beautiful pictures these were!- figures with funny heads; and, above all, the metal pig was there too. </br>	H:N
it was from the manager of a theatre; the pieces were rejected, not at all in polite terms. </br>	N:N
both swindlers requested him to come near, and asked him if he did not admire the exquisite pattern and the beautiful colours, pointing to the empty looms. </br>	N:N
one shoot after another sprouted forth, and little white buds blossomed, which the poor girl fondly kissed. </br>	N:N
so he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. </br>	N:N
the ploughshare struck against something which he fancied was a firestone, and then he saw glittering in the earth a splinter of shining metal which the plough had cut from something which gleamed brightly in the furrow. </br>	N:N
when they approached it, the cattle, who were very thirsty, saw the stream, and ran down to drink. </br>	N:N
"then he went into the house, and was welcomed kindly; and it was not long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else but looking at the lady""s eyes, and doing everything that she wished. </br>"	H:H
then the little ship sailed away; sometimes the current of the water seized it, but whenever it went too far from the shore one of the boys turned up his trousers, and went in after it, and brought it back to land. </br>	N:N
then he carried the child away to a secret place, where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by the wild beasts. </br>	D:A
i will take great care, said little red-cap to her mother, and gave her hand on it. </br>	H:N
with every event in the life of man the bell had made its voice heard. </br>	N:N
"ah, you poor child, answered the old woman, ""what a place for you to come to! </br>"	Sa:Sa
afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and hansel and gretel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven. </br>	H:H
he had a golden shoe on each foot, and why was this? </br>	N:N
you never tasted anything so good! </br>	H:N
you have no love of fatherland in you. </br>	D:N
affectation! said the shirt-collar. </br>	H:N
by her side were statues, in which the spirit of life breathed in stone; figures of men, one of whom whetted his sword, and was named the grinder; wrestling gladiators formed another group, the sword had been sharpened for them, and they strove for the goddess of beauty. </br>	N:N
but as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in his face and laughed. </br>	H:H
but these doubts were no support to her, nothing on which she could rest, and she sunk into the fathomless depths of despair. </br>	Sa:Sa
then the door of the room opened, and a number of beautiful flowers danced in. </br>	N:N
she stood on tiptoe, with her legs stretched out, as firmly as he did on his one leg. </br>	N:N
so he walked on to the river, which was deep and broad, and threw the sack containing the old drover into the water, believing it to be little claus. </br>	N:N
"well, said they, ""you are come back, and we will not sell you again for all the riches in the world."" </br>"	H:H
a gig was coming along the road; it was driven by mr. mcgregor, and beside him sat mrs. mcgregor in her best bonnet. </br>	N:N
those upstairs waited for the drink, but clever elsie still did not come. </br>	Sa:N
and they flew together over zealand, over green forests and blue lakes. </br>	N:N
a large doll, still handsome, though rather old, for her neck had been mended, lay inside one of the drawers which was partly open. </br>	N:N
so he took the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his bargain. </br>	H:H
the wolf answered: </br>	N:N
"when she awoke, and wanted to see her child, the husband, with tears, said, ""we have closed the coffin; it was necessary to do so."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
but may we not punish those naughty boys? asked the young storks. </br>	A:N
he led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden. </br>	N:H
what do i see? replied the ass. </br>	N:N
the cat was too much surprised to scratch back. </br>	Su-:Su-
the tailor felt in his pockets, and reached him a handful; they were, however, not nuts, but pebbles. </br>	N:N
the star of gold paper still stuck in the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine. </br>	N:N
"the fox answered, ""i know a man who has been killing, and the salted meat is lying in a barrel in the cellar; we will get that."" </br>"	N:N
she wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the glass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her pocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the piece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it. </br>	Sa:N
duchess looked very much alarmed, and continued to scoop the inside of the pie-dish. </br>	F:F
both of them, the flea and the grasshopper, took care to announce who they were, and that they considered themselves entitled to marry a princess. </br>	N:N
he had little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. </br>	Sa:Sa
"they were good, joyful men, those two, ""there sits a good specimen of a toad,"" said the naturalist. </br>"	N:N
"and we can't have such a fellow as this in the summer time, replied the young man, pointing to the snow man; ""he is capital."" </br>"	N:N
he prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. </br>	Sa:Sa
and if only the brother had had his human form it would have been a delightful life. </br>	N:N
mother, i have been to warm countries! </br>	H:N
he very nearly overbalanced himself. </br>	N:N
troublesome thoughts often exist in the mind, fermenting there, which are not realized by us while the senses are as it were slumbering; but still they are there. </br>	N:N
"now, thought she to herself, ""no aid of man can be of use to me."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
good-morning, replied the sentry; for the clock had struck twelve. </br>	N:N
miss butterfly was tasting the sugar; but she flew away out of the window. </br>	N:N
the cold wind blew over the bowed backs of the willows, so that they creaked again. </br>	N:N
"who's-been- digging-up my nuts?"" </br>"	A:N
through the magic power of the goloshes, he was at once carried back three hundred years, to the times of king hans, for which he had been longing when he put them on. </br>	N:N
he began to walk frightfully lame, holding pig-wig's arm. </br>	N:F
so he left her by herself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would tear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to her fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her. </br>	F:N
but after looking at him more closely, he thought he had been civil enough, so he placed him on the floor, and opened the chest. </br>	N:N
the father's heart was bowed down, but the mother sunk completely under the deep grief. </br>	Sa:Sa
"there, she said, ""creep away, or fly, if thou canst. </br>"	H:N
he had not been there long before he began to feel so tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he could not stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep. </br>	N:N
a low sigh was heard. </br>	N:N
he felt in his pockets for some of his papers. </br>	N:N
he rode into the hall on his goat. </br>	N:N
at night when the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas certainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the crafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there was. </br>	N:N
"then she was alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was clever elsie or not, and said: ""is it i, or is it not i?"" </br>"	F:Su-
distractedly? </br>	N:N
"i don't care how humble my position is, so that i can only do some good, which will be something.
2:2	n:n	n:n	i intend to be a brickmaker; bricks are always wanted, and i shall be really doing something. </br>"	N:N
about a thousand or more years ago, there were in this country nothing but small kings, and one of them who lived on the keuterberg was very fond of hunting. </br>	N:N
"now we shall be in the green shade, said the man, as he seated himself under it, ""and the tree will have the pleasure of hearing also, but i shall only relate one story; what shall it be? </br>"	N:N
the bottle did not behold the light of day again, until it was unpacked with the rest in the wine merchant's cellar, and, for the first time, rinsed with water, which caused some very curious sensations. </br>	Su+:N
"the first was too fat: ""he""s as round as a tub,"" said she. </br>"	D:N
swiftly he sprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it. </br>	F:N
"she told him her story, and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she answered: ""no,"" for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart roland, although he had deserted her. </br>"	Sa:Su-
then he had to sing a mass, and did not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his shoulders, and said it all in his ear. </br>	H:N
the king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third demand. </br>	N:N
everything is very stupid, the weather-cock said to himself. </br>	A:A
they turned their pinafores back to front and went up with a skip and a jump; moppet's white tucker fell down into the road. </br>	N:N
what has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me! </br>	A:A
"but it happened one day that a feast was to be held in the king""s castle, so she said to the cook, ""may i go up a little while and see what is going on? </br>"	N:N
still benjamin hesitated, and peter kept pushing him-- </br>	N:N
he opened the house door quietly and shut it after them. </br>	N:N
she was a good old maiden lady! she lived yonder, behind the exchange. </br>	N:N
to be famous! </br>	H:N
"here, said he to himself, ""must i find the prize the good fairy told me of."" </br>"	N:N
the bust was cast in bronze, and part of the metal used for this purpose was the old church bell, whose tones had died away from the memory of those at home and elsewhere. </br>	N:N
what did you dream then? said the devil. </br>	N:N
she took a white chip in her mouth, and vanished instantly; this was her accomplishment. </br>	N:N
i call it portuguese singing. </br>	N:N
just another nut--or two nuts; let me crack them for you, said the chipmunk. </br>	N:N
the next time, when she again bore a beautiful boy, the false step-mother used the same treachery, but the king could not bring himself to give credit to her words. </br>	N:N
they went into the barn and hauled their parcels with a bit of string to the top of the haymow. </br>	N:N
"if the houses were asked, they could not answer; but the people would understand, and say, ""certainly the street built his house for him."" </br>"	N:N
and hardly had he done this than the blood stirred in her veins, rose into her pale face, and coloured it again. </br>	N:N
sing aloud on the happy morn, all is fulfilled, for christ is born; with songs of joy let us loudly sing, 'hallelujahs to christ our king.' </br>	N:N
"then lina said: ""fundevogel, never leave me, and i will never leave you."" </br>"	H:F
"take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house."" </br>"	A:A
then the rich man asked if might not wish for three things too, as his neighbor had done? </br>	N:N
and the rest came running to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his bed. </br>	A:A
"worse still, she neglected to make the old woman""s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the feathers might fly about. </br>"	D:N
"what have i done to deserve this?"" </br>"	F:Sa
"a funny old mother pig lived in a stye, and three little piggies had she; (ti idditty idditty) umph, umph, umph! and the little pigs said wee, wee!"" </br>"	N:N
in her joy she hastily gathered her basket full, thanked the little men, shook hands with each of them, and ran home to take her step-mother what she had longed for so much. </br>	H:H
well, he is very much like a sexton. </br>	N:N
the top, also, was no longer young; but there came a day when he looked handsomer than ever; for he was gilded all over. </br>	N:N
snikke, snakke, snak! </br>	A:N
"if i were to fall from one of these great clods, i should undoubtedly break my neck."" </br>"	F:F
springs of water flowed out of the cliff in thick waterspouts, so that there was a continual splashing. </br>	N:N
in the garden grow roses; the mistress of the house is herself the finest rose petal, she beams with joy, the joy of good deeds: however, not done in the wide world, but in her heart, and what is preserved there is not forgotten. </br>	H:H
"the prince often looked with delight upon his gold and his magnificent edifices, and thought, like the crowd: ""what a mighty prince! </br>"	H:H
i must look out, that i may not miss the opportunity. </br>	N:N
"no, said snowdrop, ""i dare not take it."" </br>"	F:F
the whole affair appears most absurd. </br>	N:N
they bore him onwards, until he found himself in a large garden, before he well knew how it had happened. </br>	N:N
yes; and he is our first printer and publisher now, replied the scholar. </br>	N:N
"then one of them called to him, ""get up, it is time; we are going into the wood, and thou must go with us."" </br>"	N:N
so ib and christina took leave of each other. </br>	N:N
the journey had cost money too, and she had derived no great pleasure from it. </br>	Sa:N
"she laid her kerchief over me, and took my bones that they might lie underneath the juniper-tree kywitt, kywitt, what a beautiful bird am i!"" </br>"	N:H
they are coming! they are coming! he cried. </br>	Su+:N
the little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they might see the prisoner with their own eyes. </br>	N:N
then the dog ran back with the princess; but in the morning, while at breakfast with the king and queen, she told them what a singular dream she had had during the night, of a dog and a soldier, that she had ridden on the dog's back, and been kissed by the soldier. </br>	Su+:N
where now were the tears he had shed? </br>	N:N
the forest had been planted for them, and the nobleman's castle had been built entirely that they might be cooked and laid on silver dishes. </br>	N:N
then she sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the misfortune which lay before her. </br>	Sa:Sa
the nobleman's castle, perhaps, has fallen to decay, said the snail-father, or the burdock wood may have grown out. </br>	N:N
a spark from the fireworks which remained had set it on fire; it was burnt to ashes! </br>	Su-:N
the black dress suited mamma very well, and she wore mourning the longest. </br>	Sa:N
the toad was so horrified at this, that she came crawling straight up towards the fowl. </br>	F:F
miss moppet ties up her head in a duster and sits before the fire. </br>	N:N
"in the meantime came the parson; the miller""s wife received him well, and said: ""my husband is out, so we will have a feast."" </br>"	H:N
you are a true successor of thorwalsden, she said to alfred; and it seemed to him as if, in this instance, mamma had said a clever thing. </br>	N:H
there must certainly be some relations of mine living here; i will just see if i can find any one with whom i can associate. </br>	N:N
"in the meantime the farmer, who had heard the noise of the fox""s jumping, came into the cellar. </br>"	N:N
i will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the third time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with me. </br>	A:N
you screamer! said the lady, throwing a white handkerchief over the cage. </br>	D:A
"alas! said she, ""i must spin this straw into gold, and i know not how."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
there was nothing to envy here, so they all showed a great deal of pity, even the two chinese. </br>	N:Sa
"towards midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it, something cried suddenly from one corner: ""au, miau! how cold we are!"" </br>"	A:N
"you little urchin! they said, ""what can you do for us?"" </br>"	Su-:A
mrs. tittlemouse had eaten the acorns before christmas; the storeroom ought to have been empty. </br>	N:N
"next morning the king came and said: ""now you must have learnt what shuddering is?"" </br>"	N:N
"its not worth the trouble,"" said the third; ""let him live, he""ll go climbing higher up the mountain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away."" </br>"	A:N
"a pink and white pie-dish! and so is mine; just like ribby's dishes; they were both bought at tabitha twitchit's."" </br>"	N:N
"thereupon the wild man appeared immediately, and said: ""what do you desire?"" </br>"	N:N
the sphinx in this sarcophagus might unveil its own mystery in the words which the living had himself written two days before- </br>	N:N
everything has been bestowed here, said the guardian angel. </br>	H:N
thus the spell was broken, and all who had been turned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. </br>	N:N
shake, shake, hazel-tree, gold and silver over me! </br>	N:N
we shall soon find it out, however when we go to the water. </br>	N:N
what did they talk about? </br>	N:N
he was an incurably indolent person; he was not in the least afraid of mr. tod; he was simply too lazy and comfortable to move. </br>	N:D
the next day, however, he procured some good clothes and proper boots, so that our soldier soon became known as a fine gentleman, and the people visited him, and told him all the wonders that were to be seen in the town, and of the king's beautiful daughter, the princess. </br>	N:N
dark days, heavy trials, with poverty at the door, came rolling into the house upon them like the waves of the sea. </br>	Sa:N
"music! music! he cried; ""the large chinese drum! that i may not hear what they say."" </br>"	N:N
on a blade of grass, that fluttered in the air like a long, green ribbon, sat a grasshopper, cleaning his wings with his legs. </br>	N:N
the town musician was very genteel and fine. </br>	N:N
"the danish and the swedish flags wave, and danes and swedes say, ""good-day,"" and ""thank you"" to each other, not with cannons, but with a friendly shake of the hand; and they exchange white bread and biscuits with each other, because foreign articles taste the best. </br>"	N:N
here rests,- ah, it makes one feel mournful to think of him!- but here rests a man who, during sixty-seven years, was never remembered to have said a good thing; he lived only in the hope of having a good idea. </br>	N:Su-
and when they had finished speaking, the old couple crept into their houses, and came out no more; for they slept. </br>	N:N
their shapes were too graceful, their complexions too delicate, and the cut of their dresses much too elegant. </br>	N:N
ginger and pickles were the people who kept the shop. </br>	N:N
"on the second morning, stood water for washing and water for drinking before the man""s daughter as well as before the woman""s daughter. </br>"	N:N
the two elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. </br>	N:A
when they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree-- there was old brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened. </br>	F:N
. . . </br>	N:N
the wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames of fire. </br>	F:Su-
and when i was going to the post late in the afternoon--i looked up the land from the corner, and i saw mr. samuel whiskers and his wife on the run, with big bundles on a little wheelbarrow, which looked very much like mine. </br>	N:N
but they did not know what endless misery he had brought upon other countries, nor did they hear the sighs and lamentations which rose up from the debris of the destroyed cities. </br>	N:Sa
"don't say such things, or you will lose your head."" </br>"	D:N
there were three creepy-crawly people hiding in the plate rack. </br>	N:N
benjamin, who was all of atwitter, pulled peter off the windowsill. </br>	N:F
yes, certainly it is natural, replied those who had brought the presents. </br>	N:N
he went to sea in a wretched vessel, and sat at the helm, while the skipper sat over the grog-can. </br>	N:N
as he was miserly by nature, he did not like to leave the harness lying there; so he cut it off, and put it on his back; and now he had to go on foot. </br>	N:N
the whole district was in sorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to stop this. </br>	Sa:N
as soon as it was night, and the shop closed, and every one in bed except the student, the goblin stepped softly into the bedroom where the huckster's wife slept, and took away her tongue, which of course, she did not then want. </br>	N:N
"a capital piece of news.
143:143	n:n	n:-	burgomaster's charlotte has engaged herself to the state councillor's son; the betrothal took place yesterday evening. </br>"	N:N
there was no window in the hut, only a hole in the wall; and the sun rose like a globe of burnished gold, and looked through. </br>	N:N
and the boy gazed on the large, old bell with the deepest interest. </br>	N:N
he understood the gypsy woman's meaning now. </br>	H:N
you know him very well, do you not? </br>	N:N
they told him that their father was very ill, and that they were afraid nothing could save him. </br>	Sa:Sa
ida could not imagine where they could come from, unless they were the flowers from the king's garden. </br>	N:N
once more he clasped the neck of his metal horse, kissed its nose, and nodded farewell to it. </br>	Sa:N
each of them is available for one month; when that has passed, i shall write the behavior of each on his passport. </br>	N:N
then everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. </br>	Sa:Su-
mr. tod took a last look at the badger and softly left the room. </br>	N:N
"there is a difference indeed, and so there ought to be, or we should all be equals."" </br>"	N:N
"it is a duty we owe to ourselves that we may be nice and fat when we come to be embalmed with sage and onions and apples."" </br>"	N:N
this is just the kind of wind to blow life into one. </br>	H:N
"the bottle, however, knew nothing of the ""up,"" or the ""down;"" he saw only that the balloon was swelling larger and larger till it could swell no more, and began to rise and be restless. </br>"	N:N
so they brought the little lady-snail. </br>	N:N
"they leapt with delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: ""we will remember you and repay you for saving us!"" </br>"	H:H
"if we suffer wrongfully, if we are misunderstood or despised, we must think of him who was pure and holy, and who prayed for those who nailed him to the cross, ""father forgive them, for they know not what they do."" </br>"	N:N
"set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into her room, don""t forget to say, ""good morning"", and don""t peep into every corner before you do it."" </br>"	N:N
"good day, hans.
9:9	h:n	n:n	what do you bring that is good? </br>"	H:N
then he sprang from the couch dreadfully frightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full of water, and hastened to get away in time. </br>	F:F
there was a little flower garden with painted wooden palings in front of it; close by was a ditch, on its fresh green bank grew a little daisy; the sun shone as warmly and brightly upon it as on the magnificent garden flowers, and therefore it thrived well. </br>	N:N
he turned the rusty key in the lock; the rabbits below could hear it. </br>	N:N
"people are so kind; they seem really to think i do them a favour in letting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains."" </br>"	H:H
"but dummling begged so long that at last he said: ""just go then, you will get wiser by hurting yourself."" </br>"	Sa:N
what had become of those wonderful pearls? </br>	N:N
"thank you for the tin soldier my little friend, said the old man, ""and thank you also for coming to see me."" </br>"	H:N
they dragged a burning coach, and within it sat the wicked lord of the manor, who had ruled there a hundred years before. </br>	N:N
and this is what happened with these shields, when grandpapa came to the town. </br>	N:N
the little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however, repented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get rid of the hero. </br>	F:N
when the woman saw her husband, she was thunderstruck, and fell on her knees and begged for mercy. </br>	Su-:F
the trees of the forest were doomed. </br>	N:N
he took her at her word, and sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang: </br>	N:N
and they passed by everything the little girl, who was sitting behind on the stick, described, and the boy saw it, and yet they only went round the lawn. </br>	N:N
but she, trembling in every limb, did not think of the adornment. </br>	F:F
"the king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure; but still he had not enough: so he took the miller""s daughter to a yet larger heap, and said, ""all this must be spun tonight; and if it is, you shall be my queen."" </br>"	H:H
in fact the nightingale's visit was most successful. </br>	N:N
songs were sung, and cheers given; for it was a gay wedding, and they were a handsome pair. </br>	N:H

"when he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: ""what is this? </br>"	Su-:Su-
"here stood a lonely inn, and close by it a number of crippled beggars had placed themselves; the brightest among them looked, to quote the words of marryat, ""like the eldest son of famine who had just come of age."" </br>"	N:N
the tin soldiers rattled in their box; they wanted to get out and join the amusements, but they could not open the lid. </br>	N:N
"yes, said his mother, ""our heinel had a mark like a raspberry on his right arm."" </br>"	N:N
i have still two wishes left, said he, and comforted himself with that thought. </br>	N:H
trap, trap, trap! cackle, cackle, cackle! scolded the disturbed cockerel. </br>	A:A
"pray who are you, my good woman? said he; ""do you want to get in here too?"" </br>"	N:N
as if these things were of any consequence! </br>	Su-:Su-
how clearly, too, we are reminded of persons whom we have not seen for many years; they start up suddenly to the mind's eye with all their peculiarities as living realities. </br>	N:N
it would be only through mercy that i can be allowed to slip in through the gate. </br>	N:N
"now it came to pass that once when they were out hunting, news came that the king""s bride was approaching. </br>"	N:N
now it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to last three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose a bride for himself. </br>	N:N
"there was no no one else left in the house but the innkeeper""s daughter, who was honest, and had taken no part in their godless deeds. </br>"	N:N
now life is beginning again, said the tree, rejoicing in the sunshine and fresh air. </br>	H:H
in the morning, the window-panes of the housekeeper's room were covered with ice. </br>	N:N
"he took him to the miller and his wife, and as they had no children they were glad, and said, ""god has given him to us."" </br>"	H:H
he peeped through the hinges of the half-open bedroom door. </br>	N:N
he had a long way to go before he reached the river, and little claus was not a very light weight to carry. </br>	N:N
the next day the wife said to the shoemaker. </br>	N:N
i hate cow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. </br>	D:D
then she threw one of the little shirts over each of them, and no sooner had the shirts touched their bodies than they were changed into swans, and flew away over the forest. </br>	N:N
his jaws were open, his tongue hung from his mouth, and his eyes glared fearfully. </br>	N:N
"then the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot, and as the lord was wearing common clothes, and did not look like one who had much money in his pocket, he shook his head, and said, ""no, i cannot take you in, my rooms are full of herbs and seeds; and if i were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door, i might very soon go begging myself. </br>"	D:N
the lord, in a dream, had been a guide to her feet and a light to her spirit. </br>	N:N
"it must have fallen in the storm of last night.

the drummer and his wife also thought of it, for peter was at the war. </br>	N:N
so the young man agreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that nothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon. </br>	N:H
they were very good to the poor; they fed them and clothed them, and in their benevolence there was judgment as well as true christianity. </br>	N:N
all this was very delightful, and when the beetle woke up he crept forth and looked around him. </br>	N:H
then the maiden desired to see the horses which the other apprentices had brought home with them, and one of them was blind and the other lame. </br>	N:N
the poor man thought he would try to better himself; so, pulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well, and sowed turnips. </br>	N:N
the crows, ravens and magpies started up in terror at the yelling and shouting that sounded around. </br>	N:N
these were delightful stories; and when he asked the princess if she would marry him, she consented immediately. </br>	N:N
the place burnt like fire, and the poison entered into his blood. </br>	N:N
then the third son offered to keep watch; but the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself under the tree to watch. </br>	F:F
"how well they look!
66:66	h:n	h:n	how well they fit! said all. </br>"	H:N
the young people wandered away into the green wood, and talked together. </br>	N:N
"the boy cried a second time: ""what do you want here?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or i will throw you down the steps!"" </br>"	A:N

there they sat, all three; and as for alfred, a proverb may describe his position- he looked like a swan amongst the geese. </br>	N:N
when they had got into the carriage, the two other tailors, who had false hearts and envied him his good fortune, went into the stable and unscrewed the bear again. </br>	N:A
marry! ha, ha! and he laughed bitterly to himself at the thought. </br>	N:Sa
what power seemed to lie in the depths of those dark eyes! </br>	N:N
but the faithful servant who had seen all that they did, unseen by them, unfastened a little boat from the ship, got into it, sailed after his master, and let the traitors go on their way. </br>	N:N
"thanks, thanks, you heavenly little bird.
142:142	n:n	h:h	i know you well.

at this, too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always silenced her. </br>	F:F
"the servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the kitchen, and said to the cook: ""here is a fine duck; pray, kill her."" </br>"	N:N
without arms and legs! cried the mother. </br>	D:A
the hearts in the danish arms grew more and more red; while the lions, with gold crowns on their heads, were leaping up. </br>	N:N
"that was ill done, hans, you should have put a rope round the goats neck."" </br>"	A:A
"ask him, said the princess, ""if he will be satisfied with ten kisses from one of my ladies."" </br>"	N:N
the most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called silvertail. </br>	N:N
it was a wooden bird, the parrot which is used as a target as prastoe. </br>	N:N
well, she can be unmarried again, and remain here with my other daughters, said the mother. </br>	N:N
"then the king""s daughter said that they were to bring him immediately. </br>"	N:N
one sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. </br>	N:F
"when the bear heard the music, he could not help beginning to dance, and when he had danced a while, the thing pleased him so well that he said to the little tailor, ""hark you, is the fiddle heavy?"" </br>"	H:H
it was a terrible fall; for he came head downwards, his helmet and his bayonet stuck in between the flagstones, and his one leg up in the air. </br>	N:N
on the piazza dell trinita stands a slender pillar, and upon it is the goddess of justice, blindfolded, with her scales in her hand. </br>	N:N

she gives a feast on the longest day of the year, that there may be time for her guests to partake of the numerous dishes at her table. </br>	N:N
where can i see her? asked the soldier. </br>	N:N
goodbye, gretel. </br>	N:N
"the king""s son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found. </br>"	Sa:N
he is of no use! said the princess. </br>	D:D
it was a very wonderful trunk; no sooner did any one press on the lock than the trunk could fly. </br>	N:N
meanwhile st. peter and the lord were waiting, and as he was so long in coming, they set out to meet him. </br>	N:N
when the cloth was laid, the lord sat down with the man and his wife, and he enjoyed their coarse food, for there were happy faces at the table. </br>	H:H
"hereupon she was terrified, and said: ""ah, heavens! </br>"	F:F
she tried to excuse herself by saying that she would not be able to find the way thither. </br>	N:N
"a miller""s boy, who by good luck was standing there, noticed it and pulled it out with a hook, thinking that he had found a great treasure, but when he opened it there lay a pretty boy inside, quite fresh and lively. </br>"	N:N
the snores became more and more apoplectic. </br>	N:N
a long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut off his head and feet. </br>	Sa:Sa
"why, answered she, ""i did not know there was any harm in it; you should have told me."" </br>"	Sa:Su-
and i think that some day i shall have to make another, larger book, to tell you more about tom kitten! </br>	N:N
let no one ever say that a poor tailor cannot do great things and win high honors; all that is needed is that he should go to the right smithy, and what is of most consequence, that he should have good luck. </br>	N:N
"they did not awake until it was dark night, and hansel comforted his little sister and said: ""just wait, gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which i have strewn about, they will show us our way home again."" </br>"	Sa:H
his mother has given him a carrot. </br>	N:N

"no, my dear husband, it must be that one,"" said the queen, pointing to a second door having a cross also. </br>"	N:N

the faster he played, the more violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground. </br>	A:N
mother, surely you have not forgotten them. </br>	N:N
"he was very much astonished, and called his wife and said to her, ""tell me, what can have happened? </br>"	Su-:Su-
she was frightened, and wanted to throw the red shoes away; but they stuck fast. </br>	F:F
all were brothers, and the sunbeam kissed them- the poor flowers as well as the rich. </br>	N:N
each little blade of grass shall be a green tree for me, each of your white petals a fragrant flower. </br>	N:N
then he would keep his wedding-day with tiny; but now the heat of the sun was so great that it burned the earth, and made it quite hard, like a stone. </br>	N:N
the whole town, and the drum too, called him peter the drummer's boy with the red hair; but his mother kissed his red hair, and called him her golden treasure. </br>	N:N
it is said that the boys are ill-bred, forward lads, but perhaps that is not quite correct, and they will become better as they grow older. </br>	N:N
iron hans came, and already knew what had happened. </br>	A:N
do you remember what the flowers told you to say to me? said little ida. </br>	N:N
then the king called for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said was true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was of no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. </br>	N:N
"at last, however, they had pity on him, and gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and snowdrop awoke, and said, ""where am i?"" </br>"	Su+:Sa
sit fast, when you dance, said he, addressing the shoes, and slapping the soles with his hand. </br>	H:N
then the old bard struck the strings of his harp, and sang of the youthful courage of the hero, of the strength of the man, and of the greatness of his good deeds. </br>	N:N
she got out of her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it was all in vain, he still continued sleeping. </br>	A:Sa
after this fashion was anthony dressed on holidays and festivals, excepting that, instead of a high-crowned hat, he wore a kind of bonnet, and under it a knitted cap, a regular nightcap, to which he was so accustomed that it was always on his head; he had two, nightcaps i mean, not heads. </br>	N:N
how we shine; what a light we give!' </br>	H:N
but nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting-- </br>	H:N
it was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what was in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the cover to eat of it until he was quite alone. </br>	N:N
i am a bachelor of divinity, said the man. </br>	N:N
what have you there? asked another old magician, who had no name- and that was the best thing about him. </br>	Su+:N
why, you must be out of your senses, cried the farrier. </br>	Su-:Su-
"then he must have the mill, said the miller, but the king""s daughter said that the horse was there, and that he was to keep his mill as well, and took her faithful hans and set him in the coach, and drove away with him. </br>"	N:N
but tiny was not at all pleased; for she did not like the tiresome mole. </br>	Sa:Sa
and yet i would go so gladly. </br>	N:N
at last the turn came for that brother who knew the dictionary by heart; but he did not know it now; he had absolutely forgotten it altogether; and the boards seemed to re-echo with his footsteps, and the ceiling of the hall was made of looking-glass, so that he saw himself standing on his head; and at the window stood three clerks and a head clerk, and every one of them was writing down every single word that was uttered, so that it might be printed in the newspapers, and sold for a penny at the street corners. </br>	N:N
"the giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues of the castle, where he left him, saying, ""you will be able to walk the remainder of the way yourself."" </br>"	N:N
now he looked dressed, and rode on. </br>	N:N
the flames of the burning house opposite illuminated him as he sat, both hands pressed tightly over his cap, in which the treasure lay; and then he found out what feelings really reigned in his heart, and knew exactly which way they tended. </br>	N:N
now we come to the architect, the third brother, who had been first a carpenter's apprentice, had worn a cap, and served as an errand boy, but afterwards went to the academy, and risen to be an architect, a high and noble gentleman. </br>	N:N
"o man of the sea!

and then they kissed each other, and the girl wept, and gave him a rose; but before she did so, she pressed a kiss upon it so fervently that the flower opened. </br>	Sa:Sa
after that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was engraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his. </br>	N:N
when the fox felt the first string, he started so that he one leg, from pain, but he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. </br>	A:A

"ah, she answered, ""i am to look for a basketful of strawberries, and am not to go home until i can take them with me."" </br>"	N:N
then he fell on his knees before the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear jorinda: but she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she went her way. </br>	F:Sa
we are scarcely aware of their existence; and anne lisbeth did not think of any of her errors. </br>	N:N
within the flower, upon the green velvet stamens, sat a very delicate and graceful little maiden. </br>	N:N
the sun was shining on the snow when the tailor got up and dressed, and came out into the street with simpkin running before him. </br>	N:N
"i will come, i will sing to you; but you must promise me one thing."" </br>"	N:N
"upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not return, the man said to the woman: ""just go down into the cellar and see where elsie is!"" </br>"	N:N
at this moment he heard some one riding down the road, towards the farmhouse. </br>	N:N
they are afraid of me because i am ugly, he said. </br>	Sa:N
"before the sprig you gave me faded, i took a spray, and planted it in the earth; and now, as you see, it has become a large tree, and a bunch of the blossoms shall at last appear at a wedding festival, in the bouquet of your daughter."" </br>"	H:N
believe the drum, and not what your mother says! </br>	N:N
thereupon she related what had happened to her in the wood, but with every word she spoke, gold pieces fell from her mouth, until very soon the whole room was covered with them. </br>	N:N
in the centre of the floor stood a coffin filled with roses. </br>	N:N
"she had not been there long before she heard that the king""s eldest son was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows and looked out. </br>"	Su+:N
the reins flapped on the horse's back, the grocer was reading a newspaper. </br>	N:N
"but he threw quilts and pillows up in the air, got out and said: ""now anyone who likes, may drive,"" and lay down by his fire, and slept till it was day. </br>"	N:N
"but the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and crying: ""oh, what helpless chicks we are! </br>"	F:Sa
it had served its purpose, and it had been loved, which anne lisbeth's boy had not been. </br>	N:N
it is terribly warm here! he observed. </br>	Su-:N
with that they went into the castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and behind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a mile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the courtyard were stables and cow-houses. </br>	N:N
i am afraid i have not got any, mr. jackson! said mrs. tittlemouse. </br>	Sa:Sa
then the woman served up four different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine. </br>	N:N
no one could possibly have foretold this. </br>	N:N
"that is my own ring, she exclaimed, ""and if that is so the man must also be here who is coming to set me free."" </br>"	Su+:H
nothing nothing, he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the man might not see it. </br>	F:F
the bailiff, however, was afraid of the blows which he was to receive, and earnestly entreated him to excuse him from having them; for rather than that, he himself would be head-servant, and the youth should be bailiff. </br>	F:F
then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home on her marriage. </br>	H:N
but as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw all the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single grain was missing. </br>	N:N
yes, indeed, my dear ribby; where can it have gone to? said duchess. </br>	Su-:N
the air in the room was heavy and stifling, no light was burning, and from one corner came sounds of moaning and sighing. </br>	Sa:N
at last they took off her shoes, and her legs were at rest. </br>	N:N
"after work, it is well to rest, said the paper, ""and a very good opportunity to collect one's thoughts. </br>"	N:N
it was bright daylight, and he could not remember his dream, but that was not necessary, for we are not to know what will happen to us in the future. </br>	N:N
then he went to her and laid his riddle before her. </br>	N:N
but the tin soldier remained silent and held his musket tighter than ever. </br>	N:N
mr. tod came in and out of the bedroom. </br>	N:N
in the centre of one of the rooms stood an open coffin, in which lay the body of a woman, still in the bloom of youth and very beautiful. </br>	N:N
how much may it come to? said the little man. </br>	N:N
the water-god has given me two; and when we sit there, nix comes to pay us a visit, and will sing you all the songs of the mountain shepherdesses. </br>	N:N
no; there is something else on which more stress should be laid, and which ought not be left unnoticed. </br>	N:N
what a whizzing and popping they made as they went off! </br>	N:N
the youth laid it across his knees, and snap! he broke it in two in the middle like a bean-stalk, and threw it away. </br>	N:N
on this the little flea began to scream loudly. </br>	Su-:F
"then he sat himself down, and said, ""i am very much tired; sit by me, i will rest my head in your lap, and sleep a while."" </br>"	N:N
the woollen shirt was concealed by a broad, linen collar; the close jacket was buttoned up to the chin, and the cloak hung loosely over it; the trousers were tucked into the broad, tipped shoes, for the clerks wore no stockings. </br>	N:N
pickles barked till he was hoarse. </br>	A:N
the younger sat in a corner and listened with the rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean. </br>	N:N
tommy brock squeezed himself into the rabbit hole with alacrity. </br>	N:N
but when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another task. </br>	D:D
he began to run and wanted to be quite alone in his own room at home, to think of something really large for his last wish. </br>	N:N
all round the hall hung old portraits of knights in armor, and ladies in silk gowns; and the armor rattled, and the silk dresses rustled. </br>	N:N
"then the lord thought, ""i shall be no burden to the rich man, i will stay the night with him."" </br>"	N:N
"my mother prefers one that is deep and moral; but my father likes something funny, to make him laugh."" </br>"	N:N
would it not be more sensible to put the house in order? </br>	N:N
thereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them, and rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly. </br>	Sa:N
never mind what they say; you need not listen, said the mother. </br>	D:N
"when evening came, and the prince had fallen asleep, she was led into his chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: ""i have followed thee seven years. </br>"	N:N
that will be delightful, she said, and clapped her little hands for joy. </br>	H:H
how miserable it must be to be born a little bird! </br>	N:N
as soon as the artificial bird was wound up, it could sing like the real one, and could move its tail up and down, which sparkled with silver and gold. </br>	N:N
he might certainly have found a good bed on the soft moss, but the fear of wild beasts let him have no rest there, and at last he was forced to make up his mind to spend the night in a tree. </br>	F:F
the best of all things for you, replied the gypsy. </br>	H:N
but the wicked step-mother was a witch, and had seen how the two children had gone away, and had crept after them privily, as witches do creep, and had bewitched all the brooks in the forest. </br>	N:N
"then you can do me a favour, said the ferryman, ""and tell me why i must always be rowing backwards and forwards, and am never set free?"" </br>"	N:N
"the thought occurred to him, however, that the king""s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus bring him into great peril. </br>"	F:F
then she told him that the well that held the water of life was in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he wanted before the clock struck twelve. </br>	N:N
the watchman's adventures </br>	N:N
so they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the place where the woodman was. </br>	N:N
"i propose to you."" </br>"	N:N

there was really a change in the weather. </br>	N:N
that's a pair of mittens belonging to tabby kitten; i only have to iron them; she washes them herself. </br>	N:N
good gracious, what a quantity of gold there was! enough to buy all the sugar-sticks of the sweet-stuff women; all the tin soldiers, whips, and rocking-horses in the world, or even the whole town itself there was, indeed, an immense quantity. </br>	Su+:N
behave well, hans. </br>	A:N
unlucky wretch that i am! cried the carter; for he saw that the corn was almost all gone. </br>	A:A
the rain was intended to pour out at the dragon's mouth, but it ran out of his body instead, for there was a hole in the gutter. </br>	N:N
like the old minister, he looked and looked but could see nothing, as there was nothing to be seen. </br>	N:N
away ran catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. </br>	N:N
"it must be some degenerate species, said he; ""i do not know it, and it is not mentioned in any system."" </br>"	Su-:N

when the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up. </br>	Su-:Su-

the good rabbit creeps away and hides in a hole. </br>	N:F
greet the little swallow from me, if you should see him again. </br>	N:N
that is the most beautiful coat of arms in the world, said the old man. </br>	H:N
remembrance nodded, and the two old people, with the golden crowns on their heads, sat in the glowing evening sun. </br>	N:N
they were five brothers, all born fingers; they kept very proudly together, though they were of different lengths. </br>	N:N
it was a shocking place, and very dark. </br>	N:N
and then he returned into his kingdom and left her behind. </br>	N:N
"ah, thought the butterfly, ""one can't very well trust these plants in pots; they have too much to do with mankind."" </br>"	N:D
no one has the least idea. </br>	N:N
then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for he awoke and missed the princess. </br>	Su-:A
kind martha warmed a mug of beer for her, with butter and sugar- she considered this the best medicine- and then hastened to the river, washed and rinsed, badly enough, to be sure, but she did her best. </br>	N:N
that i may not tell you. </br>	Sa:N
but as the weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. </br>	F:N
"that you shall know, answered he; ""only wait until i come back."" </br>"	N:N
"when the two others returned in the evening, the eldest said, ""well, how have you got on?"" </br>"	N:N
he would lay his head quite round over his tail, and clatter with his beak, as if it had been a rattle; and then he would tell them stories all about the marshes and fens. </br>	N:N

they had hastened to bring forth flowers before they got green leaves, and in the yard all the ducklings walked up and down, and the cat too: it basked in the sun and licked the sunshine from its own paws. </br>	N:N
the beetle woke up with the noise and would have been glad to creep into the earth for shelter, but he could not. </br>	N:N

in such an hour it is easy to forget that one has spent twenty years in a loft, and a good thing it is to be able to do so. </br>	N:N

they took off their boots, that they might be more at ease, and gave them to the ladies to hold. </br>	N:N
what! is he going to propose to me? said the scissors, and she became so angry that she cut too sharply into the shirt collar, and it was obliged to be thrown by as useless. </br>	A:A
we might imagine it to be no jesting matter if the soul of the man should chance to return to him, for most probably it would seek for the body in east street without being able to find it. </br>	N:N

finding everything still, he marched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in order to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of the cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to light it. </br>	N:N
ib looked at her, and as she spoke so kindly, he took courage, and asked her if she would give him the nuts; and the woman gave them to him, and then gathered some more from the bushes for herself, quite a pocket full. </br>	H:N

everything here appeared lovely to our bottle, for it was again in the green wood, amid joy and feasting; again it heard music and song, and the noise and murmur of a crowd, especially in that part of the garden where the lamps blazed, and the paper lanterns displayed their brilliant colors. </br>	H:N
"then they threw more bread and cake into the water, and said, ""the new one is the most beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty."" </br>"	H:N
now the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and began to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out to the spring. </br>	N:N
with pleasure, my dear duchess. </br>	H:N
she seemed to know her way, and she seemed to have a quantity of luggage. </br>	N:N
now we are near the church; it stands on a high hill, under the spreading oak trees; one of them is half dead! </br>	N:N
he looked at the little lady, and she looked at him. </br>	N:N
they are better off than we are; the dead return no more. </br>	N:H
when midnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at first it was low, but it grew louder and louder. </br>	N:N

my darling, this is only a dream. </br>	N:N
"oh, it is the laundress, said he; ""she has had a little drop too much. </br>"	D:N
one dark evening, he had not even a penny to buy a candle; then all at once he remembered that there was a piece of candle stuck in the tinder-box, which he had brought from the old tree, into which the witch had helped him. </br>	N:N

now let us be men. </br>	N:N
that is very old, said the counsellor, becoming quite cheerful at the sight of this antique drawing. </br>	H:H
at last the princess agreed, but she told her chamberlain to give the prince a sleeping draught, that he might not hear or see her. </br>	N:N
all the shoemakers and tanners came running, and asked how much he wanted for them. </br>	N:N

"a farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him nothing more to eat, and said, ""i want you no longer, so take yourself off out of my stable; i shall not take you back again until you are stronger than a lion."" </br>"	N:D
everything was upset except the kitchen table. </br>	N:N

"he cut his coats without waste; according to his embroidered cloth, they were very small ends and snippets that lay about upon the table--""too narrow breadths for nought--except waistcoats for mice,"" said the tailor. </br>"	N:N

the peak of this cap was broken in the middle, so that he could easily roll it up and put it in his pocket. </br>	N:N
after he had spent some hours in the darkness, not without fear and trembling, he saw at a very short distance the glimmer of a light, and as he thought that a human habitation might be there, where he would be better off than on the branches of a tree, he got carefully down and went towards the light. </br>	N:F

that is the very thing for me, said he, and got into it. </br>	H:N
"the wife said: ""fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys."" </br>"	D:A
mrs. tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill! </br>	Su-:N
"his sons were very much grieved at their father""s sickness; and as they were walking together very mournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and asked what was the matter. </br>"	Sa:Sa
thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that nothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often went in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of his trouble. </br>	F:Sa
"the youth, however, unharnessed the horses, and drew the plough himself, saying, ""just go home, father, and bid my mother make ready a large dish of food, and in the meantime i will go over the field."" </br>"	N:N
i'm master of this house! </br>	A:N
but there was always no money; they never paid for as much as a penny- worth of peppermints. </br>	N:N
"now, my dears, said old mrs. rabbit one morning, ""you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into mr. mcgregor's garden: your father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by mrs. mcgregor."" </br>"	N:N
so the dog stretched himself out on the road, and fell fast asleep. </br>	N:N
"if you""re in want of a husband now, then will it please you to step below? </br>"	N:N
"ah, dear father, she replied, ""i come home again in great grief; during the voyage, my husband became suddenly ill and died, and if the good skipper had not given me his help, it would have gone ill with me. </br>"	Sa:Sa
enough of your foolish chatter, said the waggoner. </br>	A:N
he has a splendid touch! said the drum. </br>	H:N
"so old mr. bouncer laughed; and pressed tommy brock to come inside, to taste a slice of seed cake and ""a glass of my daughter flopsy's cowslip wine."" </br>"	N:H
"he slept and yet he did not sleep; and it appeared as if the old washerwoman looked at him with kind eyes and said, ""it would be a great pity if you did not know your lesson to-morrow morning; you helped me, and now i will help you, and providence will always keep those who help themselves;"" and at the same time the book under tuk's pillow began to move about. </br>"	N:N
when she got back to the parlor, she heard some one coughing in a fat voice; and there sat mr. jackson himself. </br>	N:N
then the beetle stepped down into the rich mud, where sat three young-lady beetles, who tittered, because they did not know what to say. </br>	N:N
gretel presents hans with a knife. </br>	N:N
the proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way together. </br>	N:H
"the other roses looked after their sister, and asked each other, ""where can she be going to?"" </br>"	Su-:N
and they barred up the window-shutters and shut out simpkin. </br>	N:N
oh, dear, sighed little claus from the top of the shed, as he saw all the good things disappear. </br>	Sa:N
a great big water-beetle came up underneath the lily leaf and tweaked the toe of one of his galoshes. </br>	N:N
the fowl looked at it first with one eye and then with the other, for she did not know what the end of this writhing would be. </br>	N:N
my song sounds best in the green wood, said the bird; but still she came willingly when she heard the emperor's wish. </br>	N:N
"with this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall, sat down to the table, and said: ""my lord, now will i search in my book where the gold is hidden."" </br>"	H:N
what has struck the boat? </br>	N:N
in walking through the street this time, he examined the houses more closely; he found that most of them were built of lath and plaster, and many had only a thatched roof. </br>	N:N
some of them ran away, the others he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. </br>	A:N
and as she lay there dead, the young king remembered what he had been obliged to promise, and was horrified at having to lie down alive in the grave, but there was no escape. </br>	F:F
the great tree had once been small; indeed, in its cradle it had been an acorn. </br>	N:N
for many long years he remained in the cellar, till at last some people came to carry away the bottles, and ours amongst the number. </br>	N:N
they ran on a little farther, and then christina fell down, and began to cry. </br>	Sa:Sa
"ah! said the fisherman, ""how happily we shall live now!"" </br>"	H:H
it was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling around, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working at her window. </br>	N:N
hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and gretel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes. </br>	N:N
he was to be taken to the country to be buried there in his own grave; so they carried him away; no one followed him, for all his friends were dead; and the little boy kissed his hand to the coffin as the hearse moved away with it. </br>	Sa:N
ding-dong! ding-dong! </br>	N:N
it burst into a flame, and where its light fell upon the wall it became as transparent as a veil, and she could see into the room. </br>	N:N
it has been said, and is preserved in popular belief, that where the rainbow touches the earth a treasure lies buried, a golden treasure; and here there was one. </br>	N:N
so from this time forward sultan had all that he could wish for. </br>	H:H
now i am perched on a stalk, like the flowers, said the butterfly. </br>	N:N
"but the king said, ""you are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each other."" </br>"	H:H
by daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and watching it. </br>	N:N
last night there was a miserable little hut standing there, and to-day there is a beautiful new house. </br>	N:N
she danced and was obliged to go on dancing over field and meadow, in rain and sunshine, by night and by day- but by night it was most horrible. </br>	N:N
at the same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away, but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself obliged to run behind. </br>	Su-:N
"give an answer, cried the boy, ""or take yourself off, you have no business here at night."" </br>"	A:N
"she was beautiful, said her mother; ""she was quite different from the beauties they call 'antiques,' for they are so damaged. </br>"	Sa:D
he had but very little luggage with him, because it was so cumbersome in the great heat; he had, however, swimming-trousers with him, which are nothing to carry. </br>	N:N
at her side sits a young man, tall and strong; he gives her a rose and she smiles. </br>	H:H
"then a man approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could see the gallows, the man said to him: ""look, there is the tree where seven men have married the ropemaker""s daughter, and are now learning how to fly. </br>"	N:N
"red-head, said the soldiers, and little peter laughed; but when one of them sometimes said to another, ""foxey,"" he would bite his teeth together and look another way- into the wide world. </br>"	N:N
"fool! thought the fire-drum; but it only said, ""dub, dub, dub, rub-a-dub!"" </br>"	Su-:A
at last the candles burnt down to the branches and were put out. </br>	N:N
there are the three golden hairs for you, said she. </br>	N:N
the flowers were dancing gracefully on the floor, making turns and holding each other by their long green leaves as they swung round. </br>	H:N
"good day, emperor, he said, ""could you not give me some employment at the court?"" </br>"	N:N
a large marble pillar lay on the ground, which, in falling, had been broken into three pieces. </br>	N:N
"the son said: ""most gracious father, i will show her to you in the form of a beautiful flower,"" and he thrust his hand into his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table, and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it. </br>"	H:H
"the second night the king""s daughter sent her maid-in-waiting, who was to see if she could succeed better in listening, but the servant took her mantle also away from her, and hunted her out with rods. </br>"	A:N
we shall never have another singing-bird again amongst us; he was almost a chinese, they whispered, and then they wept with such a noisy, clucking sound, that all the other fowls clucked too, but the ducks went about with redder eyes afterwards. </br>	Sa:Sa
she wiped her eyes with her apron. </br>	Sa:F
i understand but one, replied the cat, modestly. </br>	Sa:N
which will be my bride? </br>	N:N

"ah, yes; but you have the best of it, said the clerk; ""it must be so delightful to sit and write poetry. </br>"	N:N
but by good luck the dwarfs came in very early that evening; and when they saw snowdrop lying on the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned comb. </br>	F:N
under the little apple-tree, spring seemed busy, and told his tale from one of the branches which hung fresh and blooming, and covered with delicate pink blossoms that were just ready to open. </br>	N:N
. . . </br>	N:N
here is a little snowdrop out of the solitary wood; here is an evergreen from the flower-pot at the tavern; and here is a simple blade of grass. </br>	N:N
the door is big enough; just look, i can get in myself! and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven. </br>	D:A
two will-o'-the-wisps came jumping in, one quicker than the other, so of course, one arrived first. </br>	N:N
the king's son also received several good scratches, but the sun was shining on his way, and it is he whom we will now follow, for he was a quick fellow. </br>	N:N
the swineherd- that is to say, the prince- but they did not know otherwise than that he was a real swineherd- did not waste a single day without doing something; he made a rattle, which, when turned quickly round, played all the waltzes, galops, and polkas known since the creation of the world. </br>	N:N
in the right aisle of the church every statue on the richly carved sarcophagi seemed endowed with life. </br>	N:N
"yes, said the cat, ""he has."" </br>"	H:N
"the third said, ""i grant that she may die a miserable death."" </br>"	D:N
"when they came to their journey""s end, the youngest son brought his cup to the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. </br>"	N:N
there was so much that the pieces of furniture stood in each other's way to get a sight of the little boy. </br>	N:N
do you know only one story? asked the rats. </br>	D:N
not a singing bird was ever heard there, neither did men dance to the sound of the pipe. </br>	N:N
the servant stood by and listened. </br>	N:N
it also related that once when red-cap was again taking cakes to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the path. </br>	N:N
the rabbit babies were rather tumbled and very hungry; they were fed and put to bed. </br>	N:Sa
when a year had gone by, the king again went away, and the queen had another little boy, whom the false sisters likewise took and threw into the water. </br>	Su-:N
then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he died too; and so all were dead. </br>	Sa:Sa
the cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket. </br>	N:N
but we must not suppose it was all over; no, indeed, there was worse to come yet. </br>	N:N
"ill tell you!"" cried tom. </br>"	H:N
and yet my father was not a skin-dresser nor an executioner; on the contrary, his employment placed him at the head of the grandest people of the town, and it was his place by right. </br>	N:N
"humph!

this might have happened, indeed, if there had been a real castle, with stone walls, ramparts, and a moat. </br>	N:N
"so they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just as it did while she was alive; so they said, ""we will never bury her in the cold ground."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
she was slender and fair as moonlight, and the most graceful of all the sisters. </br>	N:N
i am death. </br>	N:N
"we had five hundred dollars, she said, ""and there was a house in the street to be sold for two hundred, so we thought it would be worth our while to pull it down and build a new one in its place; so it was bought. </br>"	N:N
then he gave him a lump of silver as big as his head. </br>	N:N
i will be an architect, which will place me among those who possess riches and intellect, and who speculate in art. </br>	N:N
the prince sat in the centre of the ship, and had only to touch a spring in order to make thousands of bullets fly out in all directions, while the guns were at once loaded again. </br>	N:N
"the church bell hangs high, and looks far around, and sees the birds around it, and understands their language.
44:44	h:n	s:n	the wind roars in upon it through windows and loopholes; and the wind knows everything, for he gets it from the air, which encircles all things, and the church bell understands his tongue, and rings it out into the world, 'ding-dong! ding-dong!'

there was no night-lamp burning, but the room appeared quite light, for the moon shone through the window upon the floor, and made it almost like day. </br>	N:N
"the woman said: ""oh, heavens! </br>"	Su-:F
the bird kissed it with its beak, sang to it, and then rose again up to the blue sky. </br>	N:N
the rich drove, the poor walked, but the way seemed to them extraordinarily long, and when they arrived at a number of willow trees on the border of the wood they sat down, looked up into the great branches and thought they were now really in the wood. </br>	N:N
this here pig is a young lady; is her name alexander? </br>	Su-:N
near the grass-covered rampart which encircles copenhagen lies a great red house. </br>	N:N
yes, it was indeed the spectre of her child. </br>	N:N
in this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without being seen. </br>	N:N
then the young bird felt that his wings were strong, as he flapped them against his sides, and rose high into the air. </br>	N:N
the boy had rosy cheeks, golden ringlets, and clear, blue eyes; he was the son of anthony, a rich merchant; it was himself. </br>	N:N
she laid some more in june, and she was permitted to keep them herself: but only four of them hatched. </br>	N:N
"we will leave him here till he confesses, said silvertail squirrel and he shouted into the hole--""who's- been-digging-up my-nuts?"" </br>"	A:N
it was, as we have said, carried far away from marbach and sold as old copper; then sent to bavaria to be melted down in a furnace. </br>	N:N
then the little door began to creak. </br>	N:N
the boy raised his hands towards the smiling children, and then the pig ran off with him through the open vestibule. </br>	H:H
at home in their wooden cottage these boys had an elder brother, a sailor, who was about to start on a long voyage. </br>	N:N
"oh my poor rabbit babies!
114:114	sa:f	f:f	what a dreadful place; i shall never see them again! sighed benjamin. </br>"	F:Sa
the gnat, who was the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled, and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be announced. </br>	N:N
"speak of him with respect, said the portuguese duck, ""for he had manners and education, and he could sing. </br>"	N:N

"now you must not take it out to-morrow to see if it has taken root, said molly; ""no one ever should do that. </br>"	N:N
on her side she would do the same, and if he died first, would go down to the grave with him. </br>	N:N

"one half of the company were already seated at the card-tables, the other half seemed to be waiting the result of their hostess's question, ""well, how shall we amuse ourselves?"" </br>"	N:N

"mother, said the little daughter again, ""may not brother have one too?"" </br>"	N:Su-
just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking outside. </br>	Su+:N
two frogs were sitting on the linen, and their bright eyes actually glistened with pleasure. </br>	H:N
"the cloak is very well, said he: ""now give me the sword."" </br>"	N:N
what a strange crackling i feel within me, he said. </br>	Su-:N
now we shall see. </br>	N:N
i shall certainly have the gout like the old cupboard. </br>	N:N

two nights after this, other men, armed with knives and muskets, came into our tent. </br>	N:N

there was once a butterfly who wished for a bride, and, as may be supposed, he wanted to choose a very pretty one from among the flowers. </br>	N:H
"then said the virgin mary, ""thou hast not obeyed me, and besides that thou hast lied, thou art no longer worthy to be in heaven."" </br>"	A:N
scarcely had he spoken these words when he heard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as black as coal flying round and round. </br>	N:N
the mouse comes a little nearer. </br>	N:N
delaying is not forgetting! </br>	N:N
whither away, hans? </br>	N:N
"hither, hither, through the sky, turtle-doves and linnets, fly!

just as the king commands, answered they, and they told the boy to hold himself in readiness. </br>	N:N

"it's much nicer here than down in the well!
33:33	h:n	+:n	i should like to stay here my whole life long! said the little toad. </br>"	H:N
here rests a happy man, that is to say, a man of high birth and position, which was very lucky for him, otherwise he would have been scarcely worth notice. </br>	N:N
the king went away, and did not find out that a false queen was lying in the bed. </br>	N:N
then he could see that the bright colors were faded from his uniform, but whether they had been washed off during his journey or from the effects of his sorrow, no one could say. </br>	N:N
these people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. </br>	N:N
"he stood still and looked at her full of surprise, then he spoke to her and said, ""who art thou? </br>"	Su+:Su+
another daughter could make a figure like herself follow her, as if she had a shadow, which none of the goblin folk ever had. </br>	N:N
but none of them knew. </br>	N:N
and a great way up the hillside she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass. </br>	Su+:N
"the old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ""oh, you dear children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. </br>"	N:Su+
heinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would not let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. </br>	N:N
he was looking for his son. </br>	N:N
pigling bland slept like a top. </br>	N:N
"i believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry."" </br>"	N:H
"i might as well go, said the snow man, ""for i think i am breaking up as it is."" </br>"	N:N
"it was only a dream, and yet i am just as tired as if i really had done everything."" </br>"	F:N
"his eyes brightened, and the words he uttered came with hesitation from his lips, but from the deepest recesses of his heart: ""christina, if you have not become too grand, and if you can be contented to live in my mother's house as my wife, we will be married some day. </br>"	H:H
the brightness is too dazzling there. </br>	N:N
"the messenger sat all this time with the beautiful young lady, and as nobody came with the salad and she longed to taste it, she said, ""i don""t know where the salad can be."" </br>"	Sa:N
"the silver and gold which is plentiful in the hill will be polished and placed out in the moonlight."" </br>"	N:N
"the wise woman said: ""there is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some morning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no matter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will be stopped."" </br>"	N:N
then they turned upon him and tried to seize him; but he drew his sword. </br>	N:N
"this really did vex him, and before he was aware, he said, ""i just wish she was sitting there on this saddle, and could not get off it, instead of my having to drag it along on my back."" </br>"	N:A
"now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long as we live."" </br>"	H:N
"so he laid hold of little claus round the body, and pushed him into the sack, which he took on his shoulders, saying, ""now i'm going to drown you in the river. </br>"	A:N
tommy brock watched him with one eye, through the window. </br>	N:N
but there was nothing to be seen; whatever he had heard had passed already. </br>	Sa:N
before going to sleep he was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep off the flies. </br>	N:N
"farewell, anthony."" </br>"	N:N
so she got into the carriage and drove away with the king, and when they arrived at his palace, the wedding was celebrated with great pomp, as the little men had granted to the maiden. </br>	H:N
"that is impossible, your grace, replied the mother; ""he is not pretty; but he has a very good disposition, and swims as well or even better than the others. </br>"	D:N
no! </br>	D:N

that was indeed much more remarkable than the rose. </br>	N:N
"oh, said she, ""it is cold out of doors now; it snows and freezes. </br>"	N:N
so the student let him down, opened the sack, and set him free. </br>	N:H
it was a long time ago, while the english fleet lay in the roads, on the second of april, when we showed that we were true, ancient danes. </br>	N:N
squeak, squeak, said a little mouse, creeping cautiously towards the tree; then came another; and they both sniffed at the fir-tree and crept between the branches. </br>	N:N
the rain poured, and not a creature could be seen in the street. </br>	N:N
ah, how beautiful is life. </br>	H:N
i advise you to do what you think will turn out to your happiness, said the girl. </br>	Sa:N
her son was not at home. </br>	N:N
at this sight she was sadly frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her seat. </br>	Su+:D
"those are difficult questions, answered she, ""but only be silent and quiet and pay attention to what the devil says when i pull out the three golden hairs."" </br>"	N:N
a woman not very young, with an unpleasant face and a quantity of black hair, followed them. </br>	N:N
the rest of the talk, however, was not so agreeable; every moment one contradicted the other. </br>	N:N
he was not allowed to remain, and little ida got over it, because she was obliged to do so. </br>	N:N
she was not installed as a real court cook. </br>	N:N
then two little boys came out of the garden; one of them had a large sharp knife, like that with which the girl had cut the tulips. </br>	N:N
suddenly there appeared a great water-rat, who lived in the drain. </br>	N:N
"then said he, ""i will only give you quite a small blow, that""s all."" </br>"	N:N
it is very naughty, said the princess, and walked off. </br>	D:N
"then the queen again said, ""no, i did not open the forbidden door;"" and the virgin took the child out of her arms, and away with her to heaven. </br>"	N:N
the nightcap, however, was not placed on his head in his coffin; he had a clean white one on then. </br>	N:N
"for the sake of the stork's nest it had been allowed to remain, although it is a blot on the landscape.
180:180	n:n	n:n	they did not like to drive the stork away; therefore the old shed was left standing, and the poor woman who dwelt in it allowed to stay.
181:181	n:n	n:n	she had the egyptian bird to thank for that; or was it perchance her reward for having once interceded for the preservation of the nest of its black brother in the forest of borreby?
182:182	n:n	n:n	at that time she, the poor woman, was a young child, a white hyacinth in a rich garden.

the sun's rays also came streaming into the stable, and shone upon him, and made the place lively and bright. </br>	N:N
"thou hast been light-fingered and hast snipped folks"" clothes away. </br>"	D:N
presently peter let the pocket- handkerchief go again. </br>	N:N
"then at the entrance of the parlour the youth again said quite loudly: ""if i could but shudder! </br>"	Sa:N
it was mistress june, in whose service people become lazy and fond of sleeping for hours. </br>	N:N
"that is all very well, said he, ""but still i do not know what it is to shudder!"" </br>"	Sa:N
"they climbed up and up;--""he was at home; i saw his black ears peeping out of the hole."" </br>"	N:N
soon afterwards the old goat came home again from the forest. </br>	N:N
but the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house, and cried out as before: </br>	F:N
but flowers cannot dance? cried little ida. </br>	N:N
on the high bank of earth, which formed a dyke on the sea-coast, a poor woman named margaret wished to build herself a house, so all the imperfect bricks were given to her, and a few whole ones with them; for the eldest brother was a kind-hearted man, although he never achieved anything higher than making bricks. </br>	N:N
but she has no one to mourn, neither father nor mother, neither relations nor sweetheart. </br>	Sa:N
for, when the mouse had made the fire and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest until it was time to set the table. </br>	N:N
the ambassador remained standing by the sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes, and then conveyed to him this proposal. </br>	N:N
"would you like to stay here and freeze when the winter comes? said the mother, ""or till the boys comes to hang you, or to roast you?- well then, i'll call them."" </br>"	D:N
then he closed the lid, seated the dog upon it again, and walked into another chamber, and, sure enough, there sat the dog with eyes as big as mill-wheels. </br>	N:N

it was morning; the metal pig stood in its old place on the porta rosa, and the boy found he had slipped nearly off its back. </br>	N:N
and what then? </br>	N:N
"but the eldest said, ""it is only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach."" </br>"	N:N
yes, i will go with you, said tiny; and she seated herself on the bird's back, with her feet on his outstretched wings, and tied her girdle to one of his strongest feathers. </br>	H:N
he went to look for two foxhound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher. </br>	N:N
the greedy king set out in all haste, and when he came to the river he beckoned to the ferry-man to put him across. </br>	N:N
"all at once the wax doll which rode on the carnival rod seemed to grow larger and taller, and it turned round and said to the paper flowers, ""how can you put such things in a child's head? they are all foolish fancies;"" and then the doll was exactly like the lawyer with the broad brimmed hat, and looked as yellow and as cross as he did; but the paper dolls struck him on his thin legs, and he shrunk up again and became quite a little wax doll. </br>"	D:A
there was no one in the nursery, and it was very quiet. </br>	N:N
"i think he will grow up pretty, and perhaps be smaller; he has remained too long in the egg, and therefore his figure is not properly formed;"" and then she stroked his neck and smoothed the feathers, saying, ""it is a drake, and therefore not of so much consequence. </br>"	N:N
counsellor knapp defended this opinion so warmly that the lady of the house immediately went over to his side, and both exclaimed against oersted's essays on ancient and modern times, in which the preference is given to our own. </br>	N:N
"what a great man that is yonder! and how high he sits!
153:153	su+:n	+:h	higher than ever i saw any one sit yet; and how he can swim! she cried, as the stork soared away through the air with outspread pinions. </br>"	Su+:N
the eldest had remained an old maid and had no nest nor young ones. </br>	N:N
"then she perceived the finger which had become golden from touching the fire of heaven, and saw well that the child had sinned, and said for the third time ""hast thou not done it?"" </br>"	A:N
"it would be much better than crossing the sea.

so little claus gave the farmer the sack containing the dried horse's skin, and received in exchange a bushel of money- full measure. </br>	N:N
there was a large house painted in many gay colours standing close to the castle and the canal, upon which latter were to be seen many ships laden with apples and pottery. </br>	N:N
he did all he could to soothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in truth, and was only thinking how she should punish him. </br>	A:A
a cold wind swept over the pastor's head; he opened his eyes, and it seemed to him as if the moon was shining into his room. </br>	N:N
unnoticed by me, she had gradually become a beautiful maiden, and i was now also a stout, strong youth. </br>	N:N

at the end of the tunnel the drain fell into a large canal over a steep place, which made it as dangerous for him as a waterfall would be to us. </br>	N:N
our windows looked into the tan-yard, which was divided into two parts by a partition of planks; in one half were many skins and hides, raw and tanned. </br>	N:N
can you lay eggs? she asked. </br>	N:N
"my stars! said she, ""what shall i do to keep frederick from seeing all this slopping about?"" </br>"	Su-:Su-
they would be very serviceable to him in this rainy weather, so he drew them on. </br>	N:N
tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip! </br>	N:N
soon after, he fell down upon an extensive lawn, and for a time pretended to sleep, but at last fell asleep in earnest. </br>	N:N
"why have i not been told of it?"" </br>"	N:N
anna maria was still arguing in shrill tones. </br>	A:A

the chinese really were fond of their emperor, and he now lay so ill that he was not expected to live. </br>	Sa:N
"the king said, ""i will make the dead alive again,"" and opened the chamber, and bade the two come out. </br>"	N:N
"the one in the middle held a mussel in its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth""s feet, and when he had taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell. </br>"	N:N
but the little boy in bed saw plainly the old castle of kronenburg, and the sound of elsinore, and holger danske, far down in the cellar, with his beard rooted to the table, and dreaming of everything that was passing above him. </br>	N:N
what did you take her? </br>	N:N
"the prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father, and said, ""i will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper fits."" </br>"	N:N
then she went home. </br>	N:N
"the father thought to himself, ""can it be ashputtel?"" </br>"	Su+:Su+
mr. mcgregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap-- </br>	N:N
the apple-tree was not broken down; for anthony himself was struck with a fever, which caused him to break down, and confined him to his bed. </br>	N:N
when it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under the stairs. </br>	N:Su-
but the tin soldier pretended not to hear. </br>	N:N
and now we shall see what happened. </br>	N:N
she became quiet, and there was a smell of peppermint. </br>	N:N
no, you must not die, said sophy, as she kissed the flowers. </br>	Sa:N
thou wilt fish long enough before thou catchest anything. </br>	N:N
then the pennies hopped and danced about in the most amusing manner. </br>	N:N
"it is so cold outside that one""s very breath freezes! </br>"	Su-:N
i was obliged, replied the yard-dog. </br>	Sa:N
they flew into the tower and out again, they looked down upon the throng below, and they also looked into the windows of the church, and screamed out aloud what they saw there. </br>	N:N
yes, sir, i will soon serve up, answered gretel. </br>	N:N
then they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a country that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was feared all must die for want. </br>	Su-:Sa
she bundled the spider out at a window. </br>	N:N
there they saw a little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or twice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then he rose and came out to them. </br>	N:N
"she started when she saw the boy, and said, ""whence do you come, and whither are you going?"" </br>"	N:N
"i dont want any at all,"" he replied, ""only every fortnight, when the other journeymen are paid, i will give thee two blows, and thou must bear them."" </br>"	N:N
i am a hen from kjoge, and then she told him how many inhabitants the town contained, and about a battle that had been fought there, which really was not worth speaking of. </br>	N:N

little marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to the table and ate. </br>	H:H
"then the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man and the princess; and the fox came and said to him, ""we will have all three, the princess, the horse, and the bird."" </br>"	N:H
so they went to bed. </br>	N:N
"they all said ""oh!"" and held up their forefingers and nodded, but a poor fisherman, who had heard the real nightingale, said, ""it sounds prettily enough, and the melodies are all alike; yet there seems something wanting, i cannot exactly tell what."" </br>"	N:N
then all the ducks came crowding round the little dead bird. </br>	N:N
"ha! said the farmer, ""then he must be ugly. </br>"	N:N
more grand and venerable to him seemed the old oaks around the proud baronial castle, where the creeping plants hung over the stony summits of the rocks; sweeter was the perfume there of the apple-blossom than in all the land of denmark. </br>	N:N

he had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and yet he and his wife did so wish to have one. </br>	Sa:N
in such sweet remembrance was the old bell cherished by the boy, who grew up in poverty to be tall and slender, with a freckled complexion and hair almost red; but his eyes were clear and blue as the deep sea, and what was his career to be? </br>	N:N
"it is getting perfectly full-up downstairs; the sitting room is full, and they are rolling along the passage; and my husband, chippy hackee, has run away and left me.

the counsellor considered the times of the danish king, hans, as the noblest and happiest. </br>	N:N
ah, yes, with all my heart, she answered, for she was glad to get away from the mother and sister. </br>	H:H
what then!- ask the town musician. </br>	N:N
do you think he gets any kisses? </br>	N:N
but mrs. tittlemouse was a resourceful person. </br>	N:N
then he touched the door with the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court, and listened when he heard so many birds singing. </br>	Su+:N
"skins, skins! they cried, mocking him; ""yes, we'll mark your skin for you, till it is black and blue."" </br>"	A:A
"look what delicate fingers he has got; madonna intended him for a glovemaker."" </br>"	N:N
and the bed which he went to bed in was generally mr. tod's. </br>	N:N
the fisherman, however, entreated him to stay, but he would not let himself be hindered, and at last the fisherman consented. </br>	N:N
and he spent seven years in the construction of wonderful ships to sail through the air, and had darts cast from the hardest steel to break the walls of heaven with. </br>	N:N
he spoke not a word about his old love; for that soon died away. </br>	N:N
every night! repeated the other. </br>	A:N
by the next morning he had to learn by heart all the towns in zealand, and all that could be described of them. </br>	N:N
however, it was all over now. </br>	N:N
it was placed in the provision basket with ham and cheese and sausages. </br>	N:N
when he threw it down before him, it unrolled itself and showed him his path. </br>	N:N
you old rag! said she. </br>	D:N
"if it were ever so small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--i should be very happy, and love it dearly."" </br>"	N:Sa
"i think, answered the bean, ""that as we have so fortunately escaped death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and repair to a foreign country."" </br>"	F:N
people of every description entered the room, and, according to their position in society, so dared they to express their admiration. </br>	N:N
the wind whistled in his ears, he heard the church door creak on its hinges as it closed, and it seemed to him as if he had lost his senses- then a cold shudder passed over him, and he awoke. </br>	Su-:N
strange merchants drive by her, and they look anxiously after their wagons laden with merchandise. </br>	N:N
tommy brock's snores continued, grunty and regular from mr. tod's bed. </br>	N:N
the little one would not grow, for he was only a common snail; but the old people, particularly the mother-snail, declared that she could easily see how he grew; and when the father said he could not perceive it, she begged him to feel the little snail's shell, and he did so, and found that the mother was right. </br>	N:N
they stopped before the picture by bronzino, in which christ is represented as standing in the lower world, with the children smiling before him, in the sweet expectation of entering heaven; and the poor boy smiled, too, for here was his heaven. </br>	H:H
these were the emperor's good and bad deeds, which stared him in the face now death sat at his heart. </br>	N:N
then timmy tiptoes came out, and went home with an umbrella. </br>	N:N
he pulled up the wonderful plant, roots and all, and placed it in his bundle. </br>	Su-:N
however, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and the king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court, fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in the court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon the walls. </br>	N:Su-
the clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons. </br>	N:N
duchess set up a howl. </br>	Su-:F
what delicious moisture! </br>	H:N
then the little tailor leapt down. </br>	N:N
when they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them; so they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and there was a chandelier in it. </br>	N:F
the space between the heavenly bodies is, to thought, no farther than the distance which we may have to walk from one friend's house to another in the same town; yet this electric shock obliges us to use our bodies here below, unless, like the watchman, we have on the goloshes of fortune. </br>	N:N
"look at the teapot; there is a story in it now."" </br>"	N:N
and after this the real nightingale was banished from the empire, and the artificial bird placed on a silk cushion close to the emperor's bed. </br>	Su-:N
it is indeed very pleasant to live in old norway. </br>	H:N
a merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a journey; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should bring back for her. </br>	N:N
that is a very pretty story, indeed, said the queen. </br>	N:N
when he had convinced himself that there was no honey in the cupboards, he began to walk down the passage. </br>	N:N
lean as a skeleton, trembling with cold, and hunger, the old man was clinging with all his thoughts to his money. </br>	N:N
and instead of a nice dish of minnows, they had a roasted grasshopper with lady-bird sauce, which frogs consider a beautiful treat; but _i_ think it must have been nasty! </br>	N:N
he has wriggled out and run away; and he is dancing a jig on top of the cupboard! </br>	H:H
"ah, she exclaimed, ""here is a gilt top."" </br>"	Su+:Su+
all that night long simpkin hunted and searched through the kitchen, peeping into cupboards and under the wainscot, and into the tea-pot where he had hidden that twist; but still he found never a mouse! </br>	N:N
"that is quite out in the great world, on the other side of the ditch, answered an earwig, ""i hope none of my children will ever go so far, it would be the death of me."" </br>"	N:F
a very old house stood once in a street with several that were quite new and clean. </br>	N:N
"white walls, and i am black myself, said the darning-needle, ""that looks well; now i can be seen, but i hope i shall not be sea-sick, or i shall break again."" </br>"	N:F
so the merchant's son could not fly any more, nor go to meet his bride. </br>	N:N
and it thrust its beak into the piece of grass, to refresh itself a little. </br>	N:N
during the whole summer poor little tiny lived quite alone in the wide forest. </br>	N:Sa
at length his longing was satisfied. </br>	H:H
she sought out the key, and when she had got it in her hand, she put it in the lock, and when she had put it in, she turned it round as well. </br>	N:N
then the elf of the rose understood the revenge of the flowers, and explained it to the queen bee, and she, with the whole swarm, buzzed about the flower-pot. </br>	N:N
"well, what can the seventh and last do?"" </br>"	N:N
the soldiers all set out, and the son of the drummer followed them. </br>	N:N
so he put the geography book under his pillow, for he had heard that this was a great help towards learning a lesson, but not always to be depended upon. </br>	N:N
oh! she is ugly, said all the lady cockchafers, although tiny was very pretty. </br>	D:N
"but is there not something beautiful in the popular belief that just as the toad is the ugliest of animals, it should often carry the most precious jewel in its head?
130:130	n:n	n:n	is it not just the same thing with men?
131:131	n:n	n:-	what a jewel that was that aesop had, and still more, socrates! </br>"	N:N
he brought enormous wealth home from the conquered towns, and gradually accumulated in his residence riches which could nowhere be equalled. </br>	N:N
then came the grasshopper: he was certainly much heavier, but he had a good figure, and wore the green uniform that was born with him. </br>	N:N
but the lion was an enchanted prince. </br>	N:Su+
he wavered in a condition between sleeping and waking. </br>	N:N
ib and christina agreed together in everything; they divided their bread and berries when they were hungry; they were partners in digging their little gardens; they ran, and crept, and played about everywhere. </br>	H:N
if you sleep in the garret, there'll be a fire in the house, and the fire-drum will have to be beaten. </br>	N:N
there they all landed, and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. </br>	N:N
and sure enough the most beautiful stories and poetry were written upon it, and only once was there a blot, which was very fortunate. </br>	N:N
they, however, did not cease, and then she threw her girdle down to them, and as this also was to no purpose, her garters, and by degrees everything that she had on that she could do without until she had nothing left but her shift. </br>	N:N
grandmother is dead now. </br>	N:N
"do leave off those dismal strains, said the parrot; ""sing something to make us laugh; laughter is the sign of the highest order of intellect. </br>"	N:N
"but the lizards continued to run up and down the riven tree; and one said to the other, ""oh, how much i was pleased with the old goblin!"" </br>"	H:H
"alas! husband, replied she, ""and a wicked bird has come into the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, i am sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it up at such a rate!"" </br>"	A:Sa
but they had scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were seven of them running behind dummling and the goose. </br>	Su-:N
"the mayor sent for the boy to come to him, and promised to take care of him, but most cruelly added that it was a good thing that his mother was dead, for ""she was good for nothing."" </br>"	D:N
"simpkin, said the tailor, ""where is my twist?"" </br>"	N:A
"why, how now, good mother, said the princess; ""what are you doing there?"" </br>"	N:Su-
"husband, said she, ""go to the fish! </br>"	N:N
"but the merchant said, ""that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels about in a shepherd""s frock!"" </br>"	N:N
"i suppose your mother is busy washing the clothes down by the river, and you are going to carry that thing to her that you have in your pocket.
10:10	n:n	n:n	it is very bad for your mother.
11:11	n:n	n:n	how much have you got in it? </br>"	N:N
i love your heart better than your crown; and yet something holy lingers round that also. </br>	N:H
presently the sailors lowered the anchor and landed. </br>	N:N
ivede-avede, cried some. </br>	N:N
accordingly, when he had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and looked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. </br>	D:Sa
but there was a grand ball in the town, and karen was invited. </br>	N:N
then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses danced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death. </br>	N:N
how has it fared with you this time? asked he. </br>	Su+:N
then they gave the whole burdock forest to the young snails as an inheritance, and repeated what they had so often said, that it was the finest place in the world, and that if they led upright and honorable lives, and their family increased, they and their children might some day be taken to the nobleman's palace, to be boiled black, and laid on a silver dish. </br>	N:H
they went jumping and rolling about, till at last they fell into the court-yard, and were broken into still smaller pieces; only the neck of the bottle managed to keep whole, and it was broken off as clean as if it had been cut with a diamond. </br>	N:N
then the elfin girl said that the stories about the ring-finger and little peter playman had not yet been told. </br>	N:N
they were the most beautiful ice-flowers any snow man could desire, but they concealed the stove. </br>	N:N
then there came to him the fragrance of thyme, followed by the more powerful scent of honeysuckle and violets; and he fancied he heard the note of the cuckoo. </br>	N:N
here is a barleycorn of a different kind to those which grow in the farmer's fields, and which the chickens eat; put it into a flower-pot, and see what will happen. </br>	N:N
the little black dwarf soon came, and walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way to get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. </br>	N:F
"look at her!
82:82	su+:n	+:-	look at her cried her little ones. as she approached the nest. </br>"	Su+:N
he found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense giant who stood in front of it. </br>	Su-:Su-
he was just about to make her an offer, when, close by the maiden, he saw a pod, with a withered flower hanging at the end. </br>	Su-:N
it was his own room. </br>	N:N
"then he thought something must have happened, and said, ""i will go into the kitchen and see."" </br>"	Su-:N
there was a chirpy noise, and a small striped chipmunk appeared with a night light, and hoped he felt better? </br>	N:N
once upon a time there was a frog called mr. jeremy fisher; he lived in a little damp house amongst the buttercups at the edge of a pond. </br>	N:N
she was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who were lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed dread lest she should awaken them. </br>	F:F
and although it was not a big house, the tailor was so poor he only rented the kitchen. </br>	N:N
"the man""s heart was heavy, and he thought: ""it would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
"already the storms were singing, ""good-night, good-night."" </br>"	N:N
"top off! cried the mouse, ""that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in your family?"" </br>"	Su-:Su-
in the morning the servants and the housemaid came in. </br>	N:N
"ah, yes, everything will be forgotten!"" </br>"	Sa:N
but the little tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go, it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it. </br>	N:N
and the cock crowed, and the day dawned in the east, and the grave was only half dug. </br>	N:N
yes, certainly; golden shoes, replied the beetle. </br>	N:N
kill me, said the poor bird; and he bent his head down to the surface of the water, and awaited death. </br>	Sa:N
she swept, and scrubbed, and dusted; and she rubbed up the furniture with bees- wax, and polished her little tin spoons. </br>	N:N
then he rang very loud, so that those above heard him, and he placed the princesses one after the other in the basket, and had them all drawn up, but when it came to his own turn he remembered the words of the elf, who had told him that his comrades did not mean well by him. </br>	N:N
but where was she? </br>	N:N
"the judges said, ""bring us a proof of this."" </br>"	N:N
go with it up to the loft, hang it on the big nail, and then pour water into it. </br>	N:N
he had not gone far before he met an old miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush singing away most joyfully. </br>	N:N
the bird's body was placed in a pretty red box; they wished to bury it with royal honours. </br>	N:N
"we never speak to them."" </br>"	N:N
then they rubbed the corners of their mouths with fish-oil, so that they might become very smooth and glib. </br>	N:N
but he never returned; for by this time he had flown far away into the lovely green forest. </br>	N:N
he strove to show them how the beauty of the mind could be displayed in the outward form, and that it was the sculptor's task to seize upon that beauty of expression, and produce it in his works. </br>	N:N
then she took hold of the third golden hair and pulled it out. </br>	N:N
surely there never was such a sleeper! </br>	N:N
away with him! </br>	D:D
oh, you poor thing; how you do work, standing there in the water! she exclaimed. </br>	Su-:N
and then he glanced at a curious round thing like an old apple, which lay near a long, leafless cabbage-stalk. </br>	N:N
is mrs. ribston at home? inquired duchess in the porch. </br>	N:N
"the tom cat, whom the mistress called, ""my little son,"" was a great favorite; he could raise his back, and purr, and could even throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way. </br>"	N:N
everything around her seemed holy, and her heart was chastened. </br>	H:N
tom kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers. </br>	N:N
what a good riddance, said the neighbors' houses. </br>	N:N
and the tree saw all the fresh bright flowers in the garden, and then looked at itself, and wished it had remained in the dark corner of the garret. </br>	N:N
every morning an old man came to clean the rooms, and to wait upon him, otherwise the old man in the knee-breeches would have been quite alone in the house. </br>	N:N
"i will do him a favor now."" </br>"	N:N
then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. </br>	Su-:N
i have had this happen to me before. </br>	N:N
he stood still on tiptoe, peeping in, till the light went out in the garret. </br>	N:N

how long we were kept in prison, i do not know; but many days and nights passed by. </br>	N:N
cakes and sweetmeats were thrown among the people. </br>	N:N
"don't speak so loud, or she will wake, said the toad, ""and then she might run away, for she is as light as swan's down. </br>"	F:N
but how surprised she was to see in the middle of the flower, a tiny little man, as white and transparent as if he had been made of crystal! </br>	Su+:Su+
she took the little girl in her arms, and they both flew upwards in brightness and joy far above the earth, where there was neither cold nor hunger nor pain, for they were with god. </br>	H:H
thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair. </br>	H:N
they went into the dairy. </br>	N:N
there was once an old estate where no one now lived to require snails; indeed, the owners had all died out, but the burdock still flourished; it grew over all the beds and walks of the garden- its growth had no check- till it became at last quite a forest of burdocks. </br>	N:N
"then came a peasant woman down the street crying: ""good jams, cheap! </br>"	N:N
the messenger described the flower so that is appearance could not be mistaken. </br>	N:N
we might fancy the soul inquiring of the police, or at the address office, or among the missing parcels, and then at length finding it at the hospital. </br>	N:N
i am a poor, honest tailor who prays for admission, replied a smooth voice. </br>	N:N
if you will never repeat it to anyone, i will tell you why. </br>	N:N
benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf. </br>	H:H
"the others are there, she thought, ""i may as well be there too,"" and ran to them; but as soon as she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. </br>"	A:N
"when therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of mourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given his father, and caused the king""s daughter to be asked in marriage, and she was promised to him. </br>"	Sa:N
"it was to choose out the youngest and the best of the king""s three daughters. </br>"	N:N
in the street below were a number of children at play, and when they caught sight of the storks, one of the boldest amongst the boys began to sing a song about them, and very soon he was joined by the rest. </br>	N:N
the man wanted to push him away; the youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all his strength, and seated himself again in his own place. </br>	A:N
in another moment all was darkness around him. </br>	N:N
and there was also a regular huckster, to whom the house belonged, and who occupied the ground floor. </br>	N:N
have no fear, said the latter to his master. </br>	H:N
as it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden and mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. </br>	N:N
"no, said the prince, ""i do not. </br>"	N:N
they did collect quantities-- because they did not lose them! </br>	N:N
"he answered: ""father, i have learnt what the birds say."" </br>"	N:N
then suddenly it appeared as if all the stars were shining with the radiance of the full moon on the many-colored flowers that decked the grave. </br>	N:N
so our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night-wind had said; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the lion forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. </br>	N:N
"when they came to the village, the son followed the fox""s counsel, and without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all night at his ease. </br>"	N:H
it seemed as if the whole art lay in the boy's fingers; and he wanted to be more than a drummer- he wanted to become musician to the town. </br>	N:N
"you have thriven well in the world hitherto, said the grinder, ""now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand in it, your fortune would be made."" </br>"	N:N

"one day the little daughter came running to her mother in the storeroom, and said, ""mother, give me an apple."" </br>"	N:N
the orders given by the shops in the town were not finished quickly; for the metal pig had taught the boy that all objects may be drawn upon paper; and florence is a picture-book in itself for any one who chooses to turn over its pages. </br>	N:N
the grocer did so; he saw the two pigs stock-still in the middle of the road. </br>	N:N
"if the stork or one of his young ones would only take me!

how the fir-tree trembled! </br>	F:F
as he reached the half-open door, he saw a light and went in. </br>	N:N
christmas-time drew near, and many young trees were cut down, some even smaller and younger than the fir-tree who enjoyed neither rest nor peace with longing to leave its forest home. </br>	N:N
it was a little small shop just the right size for dolls-- lucinda and jane doll-cook always bought their groceries at ginger and pickles. </br>	N:N
she sat down, and bent her head low over the grave, as if she could see her child through the earth that covered him- her little boy, whose smile was so vividly before her, and the gentle expression of whose eyes, even on his sick-bed, she could not forget. </br>	N:N
but nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old mr. brown with a nettle and singing-- </br>	N:N
good morning, said the soldier, touching his cap, for he had never seen such a dog in his life. </br>	N:N
this is the mouse peeping out behind the cupboard and making fun of miss moppet. </br>	H:D
she tore off her stockings, but the shoes had grown fast to her feet. </br>	N:N
and now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear the wind and bad weather. </br>	Sa:N
the tin soldier could already see daylight shining where the arch ended. </br>	N:N
in the depths of the sea my beloved sleeps sweetly; the myrtle has become an old tree, and i am a still older woman. </br>	N:N
when the brother came home, they asked him about the castle of stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own maps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. </br>	N:N
they know what a terror would come upon us if such a strange thing were to happen, as the appearance of a dead person among us. </br>	N:N

that is your opinion, is it? said the fingers, as they seized her round the body. </br>	N:N
"pray dont,"" answered he, ""it will discover us."" </br>"	D:A
his first feeling was one of anger, and then his spirits sank below zero. </br>	A:A
"at his going away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, ""take this ring, and put it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise never to make use of it to bring me hence to your father""s house."" </br>"	N:N
"it was to be one ""peep!"" and three scratches on the ground with the left foot. </br>"	N:N

and he threw down the shoes to her, </br>	N:N
the snow man had a stove scraper in his body; that was what moved him so. </br>	N:N
you are a good and civil boy, said the mayor. </br>	N:N
she caught moppet and mittens, but she could not find tom. </br>	N:N
"pray tell me if you know."" </br>"	N:H
and as the game was now to begin, all were invited to take part in it, even the children's wagon, which certainly belonged to the coarser playthings. </br>	H:N
from the book shot forth a ray of light which grew broad and full, like the stem of a tree, from which bright rays spread upward and over the student's head. </br>	N:N
the poor bird was lamenting its lost liberty, and beating its wings against the wires; and the little daisy could not speak or utter a consoling word, much as it would have liked to do so. </br>	Sa:Sa
the good rabbit peeps out of its hole . . . </br>	N:N
"all-gone; what can that mean?"" and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay down to sleep. </br>"	N:Su-

what writest thou on yonder smooth parchment, sealing it with thy seal, and intrusting it to the horsemen and servants, who ride away, far away, to the city of the pope? </br>	N:N
then he struck a light, and in a moment the dog, with eyes as big as teacups, stood before him. </br>	N:N
this was rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. </br>	N:N
one day the queen was travelling through that part of the country, and had her little daughter, who was a princess, with her. </br>	N:N
peter pricked his ears; distant sounds of fighting still echoed in the wood. </br>	N:N
and when the brothers had said this, the quarter of an hour was over, and they flew out of the window again as swans. </br>	N:N
the cat said: </br>	N:N
it would require even more than the eye of a shoemaker to know one pair from the other. </br>	N:N
in a peasant woman's humble room stood frederick the sixth, writing his name with chalk on the beam. </br>	N:N
however, on the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a token of where he had been. </br>	N:N
"thereupon st. peter gave him three groschen, and said he was to go to the baker""s and fetch some bread. </br>"	N:N
"turn back, turn back, young maiden fair, linger not in this murderers lair."" </br>"	N:N
"and when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: ""strew some white meal over my feet for me."" </br>"	N:N
benjamin shrank down under his paper bag. </br>	F:N
his back was turned towards peter, and beyond him was the gate! </br>	N:N
so the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the door of a nice trim little cottage. </br>	N:N
as soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind the cask. </br>	N:N
so up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with it. </br>	Su-:N
but the transition from a character of every-day life to one of a more gifted nature is a great transition; and so the clerk became aware of the change after a time. </br>	N:N
there was not only a foxy flavor in proof of it--there was smoke coming out of the broken pail that served as a chimney. </br>	N:N
three or four other bees put their heads out, and buzzed fiercely. </br>	N:N
ah, you have good reason to sing, said the bottle neck, which was looked upon as something very remarkable, because it had been in a balloon; nothing further was known of its history. </br>	N:N

"i have been in a lady's work-box, said the darning-needle, ""and this lady was the cook. </br>"	H:N

during these two days old anthony had not left his bed, he had not the strength to do so. </br>	N:N
the marsh will bear horse and rider, the bishop with his priests and armed men. </br>	N:N
she knew it would so soon fade; so she took only a single green leaf, carried it home, and laid it in her bible, where it remained ever green, fresh, and unfading. </br>	Su+:N
one of them wrote verses about the bell, and said that it was like the voice of a mother speaking to an intelligent and beloved child; no tune, he said, was sweeter than the sound of the bell. </br>	N:N
then a soft voice cried from the parlour: </br>	N:N
hundreds of eagles were attached to this ship, and it rose with the swiftness of an arrow up towards the sun. </br>	N:N

she certainly had not much to tell of the things up above, but she knew this, and all the frogs knew it, that the well was not all the world. </br>	N:N
"yes, if we could find the jewel in its head, said the poet, ""i too should be for cutting it open.' </br>"	N:N

oh, he was such a kind, good-hearted man, there are not many like him, and the tears rolled down her cheeks as she spoke. </br>	Sa:Sa
the sea folks sat at table in great water-tubs, and they said it was just like being at home. </br>	N:N

skins, skins, who'll buy skins? he cried, as he went through the streets. </br>	N:N
"the young fir-tree wished very much to know; so in the spring, when the swallows and the storks came, it asked, ""do you know where those trees were taken? </br>"	N:N
all the village could see that ribby was fetching the doctor. </br>	N:N
we could hear her gentle breathing as she slept; gradually it became quieter and calmer, and on her countenance beamed happiness and peace. </br>	N:H
there were two cocks- one on the dung-hill, the other on the roof. </br>	N:N
if you could only have him for a husband, you would be well provided for indeed. </br>	N:N
she would be industrious, she said, and do everything that she could; she did not mind about the wages as long as she had a roof over her, and was with good people. </br>	N:N
but marleen stood looking on, and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no need of salt. </br>	Sa:Sa
on this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. </br>	F:F
see, there goes a chip, thinking of nothing in the world but himself- only a chip. </br>	N:N
"but gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: ""i do not know how i am to do it; how do i get in?"" </br>"	F:H

soon would the storm burst, the ice break, and all who were on it be irretrievably lost. </br>	F:N
when the bailiff heard that, he was seriously alarmed and quite beside himself; he walked backwards and forwards in the room, and drops of perspiration ran down from his forehead. </br>	F:N
it is certainly cold in your forests, but still there is liberty there. </br>	N:N
and she nursed the child as she was wont to do before she disappeared. </br>	N:N
with the earliest dawn the giants went into the forest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he walked up to them quite merrily and boldly. </br>	H:H
lucie ran on, and on. </br>	N:N
so they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but said it was the will of heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back; and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her. </br>	Sa:Sa
in the morning she arose careless and happy, but when she peeped into the stable, the tailor stood gaily before her, and was as healthy as a fish in water. </br>	Su-:H
"then the wild man said: ""it lies under your mother""s pillow, you can get it there."" </br>"	N:N
and now he looks in upon us and sings. </br>	N:N
he sat in the sun, and conversed cordially with tommy brock, who was passing through the wood with a sack and a little spud which he used for digging, and some mole traps. </br>	N:N
"after all, thought he, ""that chap is pretty well taken in. </br>"	H:H
christina, however, was quite at her ease; she talked and talked, and kissed him in the most friendly manner. </br>	H:N
a little more bacon, my dear duchess? said ribby. </br>	H:N
"on the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ""why are you so sad, my friend?"" </br>"	N:Sa
they likewise talked politics. </br>	N:N

everybody in the whole town talked about the precious cloth. </br>	N:N

once upon a time there was a woodmouse, and her name was mrs. tittlemouse. </br>	N:N
"then a vise was brought, and the bear put his claws in it, and the little tailor screwed it tight, and said, ""now wait until i come with the scissors,"" and he let the bear growl as he liked, and lay down in the corner on a bundle of straw, and fell asleep. </br>"	A:A
hunger and thirst overpowered the child, and he became quite faint and ill. </br>	Sa:Sa

as he grew higher and still higher, with increased strength, his topmost boughs became broader and fuller; and in proportion to his growth, so was his self-satisfaction increased, and with it arose a joyous longing to grow higher and higher, to reach even to the warm, bright sun itself. </br>	H:H
"come in, come in! said she; ""is not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?"" </br>"	H:N
the king thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him, wanted to help him, and drew his glove off. </br>	F:F
such was the betrothal, and then came the wedding, with bride's-maids and wedding presents, all duly mentioned in the wedding speech. </br>	N:N
she sucked the honey from the flowers for food, and drank the dew from their leaves every morning. </br>	N:N
"why, certainly!"" </br>"	N:N
the little boy in bed did not know whether he had dreamt it or heard it told; the teapot stood on the table, but no elder-tree was growing out of it, and the old man who had told the story was on the point of leaving the room, and he did go out. </br>	Su-:N
i shall never forget my first love; she was a girdle, so charming, and fine, and soft, and she threw herself into a washing tub for my sake. </br>	N:N
the light streamed forth from thousands of lamps, and the rockets shot upwards towards the sky, filling the air with showers of colored fiery sparks. </br>	N:N
the six shirts were ready, only the left sleeve of the sixth was wanting. </br>	N:N
then did the widow yoke the last two oxen that remained to her to a wagon, and mounted up on the wagon, with her old servant, and travelled away across the heath out of the danish land. </br>	N:N
i well know your desire, said the cat. </br>	N:N

the soldier very soon discovered after this the value of the tinder-box. </br>	N:N
and so she crawled on as fast as she could crawl, and got out upon the highway, where the sun shone upon her, and the dust powdered her all over as she marched across the way. </br>	N:N
there was no one to wind it up, and therefore it could not sing a note. </br>	N:N
some wanted to begin with a comedy, and afterwards to have a tea party and a discussion for mental improvement, but they commenced with the latter first. </br>	N:N

the days grew shorter and more gloomy, and, dark as it was out of doors in the open air, it was still darker within the small, old-fashioned houses of the village. </br>	N:N

one of tommy brock's hind legs twitched under the blanket, but still he slept on peacefully. </br>	N:N

in olden times, hauschen street was not paved, and passengers would stumble out of one hole into another, as they generally do in unfrequented highways; and the street was so narrow, and the booths leaning against each other were so close together, that in the summer time a sail would be stretched across the street from one booth to another opposite. </br>	N:N
"the brother did not drink, although he was so thirsty, but said, ""i will wait for the next spring."" </br>"	N:N

well, one day some people came, who took hold of the flax, and pulled it up by the roots; this was painful; then it was laid in water as if they intended to drown it; and, after that, placed near a fire as if it were to be roasted; all this was very shocking. </br>	Su-:Su-

the apple-tree, which the two children had planted, grew year after year, till it became so large that it had to be transplanted into the garden, where the dew fell and the sun shone warmly. </br>	N:N
mr. tod's stick house was before him; and, for once, mr. tod was at home. </br>	N:N
so she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. </br>	N:N
poor thing! he had no thoughts of marriage; all he wanted was permission to lie among the rushes, and drink some of the water on the moor. </br>	N:N

it was to her like struggling through a large wood. </br>	N:N
her father would certainly beat her; besides, it was almost as cold at home as here, for they had only the roof to cover them, through which the wind howled, although the largest holes had been stopped up with straw and rags. </br>	F:N

they all asked what he desired, so he said he wished to get above ground back to daylight, on which they seized him by every hair that grew on his head, and thus they flew with him onto the earth again. </br>	N:N
sometimes he came to one of the windows and looked out; then the little boy nodded to him, and the old man nodded back again, till they became acquainted, and were friends, although they had never spoken to each other; but that was of no consequence. </br>	N:N

jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. </br>	F:N

but when he got over the boat, and wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down dead. </br>	H:H

this proposal was adopted by acclamation. </br>	N:H
the fish had been caught, taken to the market and sold to the cook, who took him into the kitchen and cut him open with a large knife. </br>	N:N

"your 'something' is not enough for me, said the second brother; ""what you talk of doing is nothing at all, it is journeyman's work, or might even be done by a machine. </br>"	D:N
for she had run as quickly as she could through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken off her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird might carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her little grey frock. </br>	N:N

on one side of the forest was a broad, deep river, the water flowed so rapidly that very few were able to swim against the stream. </br>	N:N

tears stood in his eyes, and glistened on his cheeks; he carried a great book and the binding was of velvet, with silver clasps. </br>	Sa:Sa
however, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them if they would go in peace or not. </br>	N:N

but in truth, isolda had not forgotten him, her faithful friend; and when both were laid in their graves, one, on each side of the church, the linden-trees that grew by each grave spread over the roof, and, bending towards each other, mingled their blossoms together. </br>	N:N
and that is what he did. </br>	N:N
they searched everywhere, even in the cellar, but he was nowhere to be found. </br>	N:N
and this is a representation of human nature. </br>	N:N
the king, however, had a wicked mother who was dissatisfied with this marriage and spoke ill of the young queen. </br>	D:A
she looked in the pantry under the staircase, and she searched the best spare bedroom that was all covered up with dust sheets. </br>	N:N
the bottle knew not, it travelled onward and onward, and at last all this wandering about became wearisome; at all events it was not its usual occupation. </br>	N:N
unlucky wretch that i am! cried he. </br>	A:A
where does your grandmother live, little red-cap? </br>	N:N
it was her pet idea to see a great city, so she flew to copenhagen. </br>	N:N
"he looked how much meal was left in the chest, and seemed dissatisfied--""you'll likely be moving on again?"" said he to pigling bland. </br>"	N:N
all the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were peter rabbit and benjamin bunny! </br>	N:N
but the envelope remained. </br>	N:N
"how dark it was inside the wolf""; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. </br>"	N:F
he was alive but very weak; he could only open his eyes for a moment to look at tiny, who stood by holding a piece of decayed wood in her hand, for she had no other lantern. </br>	N:N
old mr. bouncer coughed and laughed; and tommy brock puffed and grinned. </br>	H:H
good heavens! listen to the voice of an innocent child, said the father, and one whispered to the other what the child had said. </br>	Su+:Su-
how sweetly they sing there; it is quite a pleasure to listen to them! </br>	H:H
he took a rope and an axe with him, went forth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to wait outside. </br>	N:N
well, i declare, there lies a pair of goloshes, said the watchman. </br>	Su+:N
up through the clouds came the green summits of the forest trees, and beneath him, the oak saw them rising, and growing higher and higher. </br>	Su+:N
"then he said to his beloved: ""i must now go and leave you, i give you a ring as a remembrance of me. </br>"	Sa:N
suddenly two horses came galloping up to be watered. </br>	N:N
these wishing nuts, after all, had proved true fortune-tellers. </br>	N:N
i will destroy everything that can remind me of her, or of lady halle, or lady venus, the heathen woman. </br>	A:N
the boy was dazzled by so much glitter; for the walls were gleaming with bright colors, all appeared living reality. </br>	Su+:H
"ha! ha! ha!"" laughed polly, and repeated his witty saying, ""now let us be men."" </br>"	H:H
"a little frightened voice called out ""who's that?"" </br>"	F:F
"many will take more than they ought, but they don't call that drinking!
45:45	a:a	a:-	they are all right, you are good for nothing indeed! cried martha indignantly. </br>"	A:N
oh, what a splendour! </br>	H:H
but the wicked step-mother, because of whom the children had gone out into the world, thought all the time that the sister had been torn to pieces by the wild beasts in the wood, and that the brother had been shot for a roebuck by the huntsmen. </br>	N:N
now, whether it was that they had eaten so many nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not, i do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not become them to go home on foot. </br>	N:N
the dog of the regiment sprang on in front with large bounds, and made the way three times as long for himself as it really was. </br>	N:H
"good-day, babbitty bumble; i should be glad to buy some bees- wax.
26:26	n:n	n:n	but what are you doing down here?
27:27	d:n	d:n	why do you always come in at a window, and say, zizz, bizz, bizzz? </br>"	N:N
"then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, ""why did not you listen to me? </br>"	Sa:Sa
then the old woman took hold of a golden hair, pulled it out, and laid it down near her. </br>	N:N
what tricks have you been playing? said the old goblin. </br>	A:N
except a spider who came out of a crack in the ceiling and examined the knots critically, from a safe distance. </br>	N:N
i will wake him up with an unpleasant surprise, said mr. tod. </br>	H:N
"no, thank you, said the swineherd: ""ten kisses from the princess, or i keep my pot."" </br>"	N:N
many a poor mother fled, her naked baby in her arms, behind the still smoking walls of her cottage; but also there the soldiers followed her, and when they found her, she served as new nourishment to their diabolical enjoyments; demons could not possibly have done worse things than these soldiers! </br>	Su-:F
we might go together, said the king's son. </br>	N:N
however, as her daughter let her have no peace, the mother at last yielded, made her a magnificent dress of fur, which she was obliged to put on, and gave her bread-and-butter and cake with her. </br>	N:N
farewell bright sun, she cried, stretching out her arm towards it; and then she walked a short distance from the house; for the corn had been cut, and only the dry stubble remained in the fields. </br>	Sa:N
the servant then came to clean out the dust-bin. </br>	N:N
the children did not at first understand what she said. </br>	N:N
i left him lying there, and rode on farther. </br>	N:N
there was a great inquiry about this wonderful nightingale, whom all the world knew, but who was unknown to the court. </br>	N:N
the king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the ante-chamber. </br>	H:H
"whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and read on his girdle: ""seven at one stroke."" </br>"	N:N
but the little kids knew that it was the wolf, by the rough voice. </br>	N:N
"good morning, said he to little claus; ""you are come betimes to-day."" </br>"	N:N
when i awoke, i found myself in a prison; but the room was not worse than our own in the hut. </br>	Su-:N
the wolf-skins that covered the bed in which my mother and anastasia slept, had been taken from wolves which i had myself shot. </br>	N:N
but nutkin skipped up and down, singing-- </br>	N:N
"faith, said he, ""that was a little better, wasn""t it?"" </br>"	H:N
he travelled about a long time in search of it and came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for fourteen days and still could not find a way out. </br>	F:Sa
"into the tower came also the dapper man-servant of the bishop; and when i, the bell, who am made of metal, rang hard and loud, and swung to and fro, i might have beaten out his brains.
25:25	n:n	h:n	he sat down close under me, and played with two little sticks as if they had been a stringed instrument; and he sang to it.
26:26	n:n	h:n	'now i may sing it out aloud, though at other times i may not whisper it.

32:32	sa:n	s:-	not even now, for the bell is ringing and singing its loud ding-dong, ding-dong!'
33:33	n:n	s:n	there was a king in those days. </br>"	F:A
i am sure the pretty bird will fly down and call upon them. </br>	N:N
a long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through all the land. </br>	N:N
"now, then, gretel, she cried to the girl, ""stir yourself, and bring some water. </br>"	N:N
there they found the princess sitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was lying asleep, with his head upon her lap. </br>	N:N
she had gone home. </br>	N:N
the builder was a man of low origin, but possessing great pride; his eyes and forehead spoke of large intellect, and waldemar daa was fond of listening to him, and so was waldemar's daughter ida, the eldest, now about fifteen years old; and while he was building the ship for the father, he was building for himself a castle in the air, in which he and ida were to live when they were married. </br>	N:N
the little fishes, who swam about in the water beneath, had seen the toad, and heard what she said, so they lifted their heads above the water to look at the little maiden. </br>	N:N
then hans built the small house, and said that he had now done everything, and still he had no horse. </br>	N:N
the soldier immediately cut off her head, and there she lay on the ground. </br>	Su-:N
after some time he took it in his head that he would travel to rome. </br>	N:N
she said this merrily, for she was the best of the hens, and, moreover, as had been said, very respectable. </br>	H:H
why do you not laugh? </br>	N:N
he no sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his sickness leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days. </br>	N:H
they raced and squealed and pelted down the long white hill towards the bridge. </br>	N:N
send in all the bills again to everybody `with compliments,' replied ginger. </br>	N:N
much good that will be to me, said the top; and they spoke to each other no more. </br>	A:N
it is not so with the human heart! </br>	Sa:N
in the forest that extends from the banks of the gudenau, in north jutland, a long way into the country, and not far from the clear stream, rises a great ridge of land, which stretches through the wood like a wall. </br>	N:N
so he drew them on, thrust his papers into his pocket, placed a few manuscripts under his arm, which he had to take with him, and to make abstracts from at home. </br>	N:N
but sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed his locks for him finely. </br>	N:N
he took the gold crown from his head, and placed it on hers, and asked her name, and if she would be his wife, and queen over all the flowers. </br>	N:N
he described everything so clearly, that those who listened could see it all; they could see the saw-mills going, the men-servants and the maidens singing songs, and dancing a rattling dance,- when all at once the old goblin gave the old elfin maiden a kiss, such a tremendous kiss, and yet they were almost strangers to each other. </br>	N:N
this night it is a horrible pit to devour up lives, and to-morrow, perhaps, it may be a glassy mirror- even as in the old time that we have buried. </br>	N:N
"they, most likely, will know of a wife for our youngster."" </br>"	N:N
so the tailor took his needle, and with a few large stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these, and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then reached the ship and got home safe. </br>	H:H
the pearl of sorrow, the last, which must not be wanting, increases the lustre, and explains the meaning of all the other pearls. </br>	N:N
there is plenty in the kitchen- dead game and poultry, hams and sausages; and fat fish swim in the ponds without. </br>	N:N
yes, my child, said the wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest had a very heavy lid and a large iron lock. </br>	N:N
he had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds. </br>	N:N
she was as a living reality in his little dwelling in the danish land. </br>	N:N
so then they went on at a rapid pace through the streets of florence, till they came to the square before the church of santa croce. </br>	N:N
i should like very much to see her, thought the soldier; but he could not obtain permission to do so. </br>	N:N
"through the forest, and in the vale, sweetly warbles the nightingale.
110:110	n:n	n:h	this song was often in his mouth, and he sung or whistled it on a moonlight night, when he rode on horseback along the deep, hollow way, on his road to weimar, to visit molly.
111:111	n:n	n:n	he wished to arrive unexpectedly, and so indeed he did.
112:112	h:n	h:h	he was received with a hearty welcome, and introduced to plenty of grand and pleasant company, where overflowing winecups were passed about.
113:113	n:n	n:n	a pretty room and a good bed were provided for him, and yet his reception was not what he had expected and dreamed it would be.
114:114	n:n	n:s	he could not comprehend his own feelings nor the feelings of others; but it is easily understood how a person can be admitted into a house or a family without becoming one of them.
115:115	n:n	n:n	we converse in company with those we meet, as we converse with our fellow-travellers in a stage-coach, on a journey; we know nothing of them, and perhaps all the while we are incommoding one another, and each is wishing himself or his neighbor away.
116:116	n:n	n:n	something of this kind anthony felt when molly talked to him of old times.
117:117	n:n	n:n	i am a straightforward girl,"" she said, ""and i will tell you myself how it is. </br>"	H:N
people said it could not be sold at the shop, to wrap up butter and sugar, because it had been written upon. </br>	N:N
"hooray! now we shall ride far away, many miles! said the boy; ""we shall ride to the nobleman's estate where we were last year."" </br>"	H:N
it was a perfect bird, with a beak and feathers, and could not have been dead long, and was lying just where the mole had made his passage. </br>	N:N
the sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might think he was a ghost. </br>	N:N
"i see that you are useful, as well as ornamental, my little lady."" </br>"	H:N
that would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me! thought the little tailor. </br>	H:Su+
"now i must do it!"" </br>"	H:N
ah! </br>	H:Su-
and then he gave her back her lost soul, and brought her into the church. </br>	N:N
"i may perhaps win a hundred thousand dollars in the lottery, said the naval officer's widow; ""and if i do, we will travel- i and my daughter; and you, mr. alfred, must be our guide. </br>"	H:N
i am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck. </br>	H:N
they did as they were bidden, and the princess kissed him. </br>	N:N
"he looked a personification of fasting; but he carried his nose very high, for he was related to the ""forty (k)nights,"" and was a weather prophet. </br>"	N:N
i have a little gold of my own, it shall be yours. </br>	N:N
"so they both went out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone far before the dog said, ""i am very much tired--i should like to take a nap."" </br>"	N:N
then he would wait no longer, but flew away, to commence his wooing at once. </br>	D:N
mr. tod came back yet again into the bedroom with a clothes line. </br>	N:N
"how are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?"" </br>"	Sa:Sa
"ah! the fool, answered the devil; ""when any one comes and wants to go across he must put the oar in his hand, and the other man will have to ferry and he will be free."" </br>"	H:N
in consequence of this dislike, the sexton had gone to visit the farmer's wife during her husband's absence from home, and the good woman had placed before him the best she had in the house to eat. </br>	N:N
they asked for the finest silk and the most precious gold-cloth; all they got they did away with, and worked at the empty looms till late at night. </br>	N:N
the poor lark was most unhappy as a prisoner in a cage. </br>	Sa:Sa
"i promise you i will not say it any more, said the other; but as soon as people came by, nodding to him, and wishing him ""good day,"" he became so pleased, and thought how grand it looked to have five horses ploughing in his field, that he cried out again, ""gee-up, all my horses!"" </br>"	H:H
the mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of black pudding, and marleen still wept without ceasing. </br>	Sa:Sa
"this is not a bad story, said the soldier; ""but what am i to give you, you old witch? for, of course, you do not mean to tell me all this for nothing."" </br>"	N:N
however, the prince would have her come; and she first washed her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached her the golden slipper. </br>	N:N
a holy calm rested on her face, as if the earthly remains bore the impress of the truth that she now stood in the presence of god. </br>	N:N
yonder, on the heath, near the town of wiborg, in jutland, stood the fine new house of the canon. </br>	N:N
what did gretel give you? </br>	N:N
"then she strewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her cleverness, and said, ""how very neat and clean it looks!"" </br>"	H:H
so chin-chin and suck-suck went away in a wheel-barrow, and stumpy, yock-yock and cross- patch rode away in a cart. </br>	N:N
"no, replied ginger, who had opened the envelope, ""it is the rates and taxes, 3 pounds 19 11 3/4."" [pounds are british money, the 19 is schillings, and then pence] </br>"	N:N
they could sing with the bird, which they often did. </br>	N:N
the third task was the hardest. </br>	N:N
her graceful limbs appeared to move; dolphins sprang at her feet, and immortality shone from her eyes. </br>	N:N
this grieved him very much, for lily was his dearest child; and as he was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a fine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it seemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter. </br>	Sa:Sa
there it lay empty, and without a cork, and it had a peculiar feeling, as if it wanted something it knew not what. </br>	N:N
the giant, however, had scarcely taken two steps with his long legs before he was in the furrow. </br>	N:N
but it is unwise to argue with the police; he gave his brother a peppermint, and watched him out of sight. </br>	N:N
"after a time, all the cockchafers turned up their feelers, and said, ""she has only two legs! how ugly that looks."" </br>"	Su-:N
she looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was? </br>	Su-:F
it was all very well for those who knew him, but not for strangers. </br>	N:N
"a considerable time elapsed: one said to the other, ""i really wonder if there is a church out in the wood. </br>"	N:N
the children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation. </br>	N:N
then they went to bed: but dame ilsabill could not sleep all night for thinking what she should be next. </br>	N:N
now there was great sorrow, as the bird could only be allowed to play once a year; and even that was dangerous for the works inside it. </br>	Sa:Sa
then she awoke, and was very much frightened; but he told her he was a turkish angel, who had come down through the air to see her, which pleased her very much. </br>	H:F
now every one came out of church, and the old lady stepped into her carriage. </br>	N:N
the root was torn from the ground just at the moment when in his dream he fancied it was being loosened from the earth. </br>	Su+:N
there was a golden treasure in his bosom, the power of sound; it burst forth on his violin as if the instrument had been a complete organ, and as if all the elves of a midsummer night were dancing across the strings. </br>	N:N
what did gretel give you? </br>	N:N
"then he ran after him with the knife still in his hand, crying: ""just one, just one,"" meaning that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. </br>"	F:Sa
the scullion said, </br>	N:N
with gretel. </br>	N:N
"oh, cried he, springing backwards, ""i saw him, and he is exactly like our sexton. </br>"	Su-:N
"may i see you paint? asked the boy; ""may i see you put the picture on this white canvas?"" </br>"	N:N
the apple-blossoms, though they looked like roses, bloomed to-day, but might fall off to-morrow, with the first wind that blew; and he thought that a marriage with one of them might last too short a time. </br>	N:N
"oh!

and the rain fell upon the burdock-leaves, to play the drum for them, and the sun shone to paint colors on the burdock forest for them, and they were very happy; the whole family were entirely and perfectly happy. </br>	H:H

he was astonished when he saw them come alone, and asked what had happened to them. </br>	Su-:Su-

after he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal palace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep. </br>	N:N
he next flew to the anemones; these were rather sour to his taste. </br>	N:D
"so now i am a breast-pin, said the darning-needle; ""i knew very well i should come to honor some day: merit is sure to rise;"" and she laughed, quietly to herself, for of course no one ever saw a darning-needle laugh. </br>"	N:H

he stood before the mayor in his poor but clean and well-mended clothes, with heavy wooden shoes on his feet, looking as humble as if it had been the king himself. </br>	N:N
the boy drew the bottle from his pocket, and the mother put it to her lips, and drank a little. </br>	N:N

when she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who was called roland, and knocked at his door. </br>	F:N
where are you going, chanticleer? said he. </br>	N:N
then came a staircase which went up a long way, and then came down a little way and led to a balcony, which was in a very ruinous state. </br>	N:N
he had never wanted to go; and the idea of standing all by himself in a crowded market, to be stared at, pushed, and hired by some big strange farmer was very disagreeable-- </br>	D:Sa

"then the young prince said, ""all this shall not frighten me; i will go and see this briar rose."" </br>"	N:N
he sat and smiled, and the water dripped off his coat tails. </br>	H:H
then the woman promised to lead the children to the right path, that they might find their way home: and they went forward certainly in quite another direction to the one they meant to take; therefore no one ought to speak against the woman, and say that she wanted to steal the children. </br>	N:N
when he had carefully locked the door, he lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. </br>	N:N
jemima puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying. </br>	N:N

whilst he was there, a great giant came over the hill. </br>	N:N
the two cats ran to look at the dough pan. </br>	N:N

one must encourage art, she said. </br>	N:N
they sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. </br>	N:N

in front of the castle a number of little trees surrounded a piece of looking-glass, which was intended to represent a transparent lake. </br>	N:N

"that was still not enough for the giant; he again suckled him for two years, and when he then went with him into the forest and said, ""now just tear up a proper stick for me,"" the boy tore up the strongest oak-tree from the earth, so that it split, and that was a mere trifle to him. </br>"	N:N
"as they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve o""clock the young man met the princes going to the bath and gave her the kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears that he would let her take leave of her father. </br>"	Sa:Sa
suddenly the boat shot under a bridge which formed a part of a drain, and then it was as dark as the tin soldier's box. </br>	N:N

then she saw a forest-hut, and went into it, and found a room with six little beds, but she did not venture to get into one of them, but crept under one, and lay down on the hard ground, intending to pass the night there. </br>	N:N

there are certain things in the world which should be uttered very cautiously; doubly so when the speaker has on his feet the goloshes of fortune. </br>	N:N
jemima puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest. </br>	N:N
then she was placed with her accomplice in a ship which had been pierced with holes, and sent out to sea, where they soon sank amid the waves. </br>	N:N
they found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and lentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide them in the moonlight along the path. </br>	N:N
"then she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she raised up her voice to it, and said, ""thou blowest through every tree and under every leaf--hast thou not seen my white dove?"" </br>"	N:N
what makes you pant so, my friend? said the ass. </br>	N:Su-

the dwarf said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle, and went his way. </br>	H:N
he could scarcely reach the water jug that he had placed by his bed, and the last drop was gone. </br>	N:N
the fox's skin, the honorable sign of the furrier, was found fastened to the bell-pull of a young man who always went to early lecture, and looked like a furled umbrella. </br>	N:N
the second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was setting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. </br>	N:N

then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him on the wave. </br>	N:N
so they handed him out acorn cupfuls of honeydew through the window, and he was not at all offended. </br>	N:N
"* ""i want a voice,"" or, ""i have no voice."" </br>"	N:N
he would have liked such a conjuror as little claus carried in his sack. </br>	N:N

pigling bland reproved alexander. </br>	A:A

"then they would hear it again, and exclaim ""oh, how beautiful is the nightingale's song!"" </br>"	H:N

the little lady was a dancer, and she stretched out both her arms, and raised one of her legs so high, that the tin soldier could not see it at all, and he thought that she, like himself, had only one leg. </br>	N:N
as soon as they had satisfied themselves, they put out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to his own liking. </br>	H:N
however, he had a splendid funeral, with the city flags and music in the procession; flowers were strewn on the pavement, and three orations were spoken over his grave, each one longer than the other. </br>	N:N
she received the king as if she had been expecting him, and he saw that she was very beautiful, but still she did not please him, and he could not look at her without secret horror. </br>	D:F

there was such a noise that the canary woke up and began to talk, and in poetry too. </br>	N:N
the other woman lifted up hers to defend herself, and the two pots clashed together so violently that they were dashed to pieces, and fire and ashes flew about the room. </br>	N:N
the boy made a hole in the earth with his finger, and the little girl placed the pip in the hole, and then they both covered it over with earth. </br>	N:N

this lasted for many years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as seeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. </br>	N:N
poor little creature! they said, one after another, as they came up. </br>	N:Sa
the third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she went again into the garden, and said: </br>	N:N

it was late in the autumn; the vine-leaves still hung upon the branches of the vines, but they were already tinted with red and gold; heavy showers fell on the surrounding country, and the cold autumn wind blew sharp and strong. </br>	N:N
they could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when night came on, they went into a wood to sleep. </br>	N:N
then the playthings began to have their own games together, to pay visits, to have sham fights, and to give balls. </br>	N:N

the nurse did not answer, but when the queen had gone again, went to the king and told him all. </br>	N:N

aunt pettitoes and i dragged him out by the hind legs. </br>	N:N
the turf blazed brightly on the hearth, and within was sunlight, the sparkling light from the sunny eyes of a child; the birdlike tones from the rosy lips ringing like the song of a lark in spring. </br>	N:N

now we are at the smithy, where the fire roars and the half-naked men beat with their hammers so that the sparks fly far and wide. </br>	N:N

the young sparrows now had feathers, and wanted very much to fly with their mother; but she would not allow it, and so they had to stay at home. </br>	N:N

the young ones above and below- those below were really only shadows in the water- were sparrows; their parents were sparrows too, and had taken possession of the empty swallows' nest of last year, and now lived in it as if it were their own property. </br>	N:N
now old mr. brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again. </br>	N:N
"thou hast wished me on it, so thou must help me off."" </br>"	A:N
"the woman was satisfied with this; but the king""s armour-bearer, who had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of the whole plot. </br>"	H:N
now the servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing the salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on the way she too felt a wish to taste it as the old woman had done, and ate some leaves; so she also was turned into an ass and ran after the other, letting the dish with the salad fall on the ground. </br>	F:N
do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo her. </br>	H:N
but there was no answer from the watchman. </br>	N:N
"fourteen years ago he floated down to the mill-dam in a box, and the mill-boy pulled him out of the water."" </br>"	N:N
you have had the trouble and we shall have the reward. </br>	H:H
mr. jackson rose ponderously from the table, and began to look into the cupboards. </br>	N:N
"then said the princess, ""i have two kinds of hair on my head, of what color is it?"" </br>"	N:N
he hurried himself as much as he could; but he found the roses all closed up, and he could not get in; not a single rose stood open. </br>	N:N
then he pricked pigling with the pin that had fastened his pig paper; and when pigling slapped him he dropped the pin, and tried to take pigling's pin, and the papers got mixed up. </br>	A:N
one of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on the little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off easily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang into the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was hiding there. </br>	N:N
then she was silent, but the desire in her heart was not stilled, but gnawed there and tormented her, and let her have no rest. </br>	A:Sa
when they came to the spot where lay the dead bird, the mole pushed his broad nose through the ceiling, the earth gave way, so that there was a large hole, and the daylight shone into the passage. </br>	N:N
nothing could be seen of the young family. </br>	N:N
but there was another surprise and fright in store for them. </br>	N:N
next day he moved into a pollard willow near the lake, frightening the wild ducks and the water rats. </br>	N:F
so the giants were left behind with no goods to share or quarrel about. </br>	N:N
"oh, yes! replied little claus, ""my conjuror can do anything i ask him,- can you not?"" he asked, treading at the same time on the sack till it squeaked. </br>"	N:N
it was not so, however; there was a being standing before his bed, and looking like the ghost of his deceased wife. </br>	N:N
bless me! cried the miller, and went there and found the wine. </br>	Su+:Su+
then she drew the linen ashore, wet as it was, and laid it in a basket. </br>	N:N
they could not find room in the hut, nor endure the smoke that rolled along the ceiling till it found its way out at the low door; so they pitched their tents on a small space outside our dwelling. </br>	N:N
years passed by: anthony's father died, and strangers lived in the old house. </br>	N:N
it is a large venerable tree, though a little crippled by age. </br>	N:N
"ah! said he, ""i have this load to carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that i can""t hold up my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly."" </br>"	D:Sa
"then the king""s daughter thanked him, and said to her maidens: ""show some strength, and step firmly on the peas."" </br>"	F:N
the king said yes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to him, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the district or country. </br>	N:N
how his admiration increased when he saw therein a maiden of the greatest beauty! </br>	H:H
and here is one, and there is another! they all exclaimed; for there were crosses on all the doors in every direction. </br>	Su-:Su-
the others were either blind, or had withered legs, which obliged them to creep about on their hands and knees, or they had shrivelled arms and hands without fingers. </br>	N:N
"but the clever son answered: ""if i give you my cake and wine, i shall have none for myself; be off with you,"" and he left the little man standing and went on. </br>"	A:A
"and we again answered, ""yes."" </br>"	N:N
"it is fine to have such cheerful neighbours."" </br>"	H:N
and then martha repeated to the laundress, in a very few minutes, all that the mayor had said to her boy, which she had overheard; and she felt very angry that any man could speak, as he had done, of a mother to her own child, about the few drops she had taken; and she was still more angry because, on that very day, the mayor was going to have a dinner-party, at which there would be wine, strong, rich wine, drunk by the bottle. </br>	A:A
it trembled so with joy in all its branches, that one of the candles fell among the green leaves and burnt some of them. </br>	H:H
tell us your opinion- we'll keep to ours just the same though. </br>	N:N

down below there was a noise of nutcrackers, and a fat squirrel voice and a thin squirrel voice were singing together-- </br>	H:N
"we'll dance the bung out of the cask at carnival time, said he; ""i'll prepare a merry tune for you and for myself too. </br>"	H:N
"good gracious! he exclaimed; ""what in the world has happened to the bishop? what can he be thinking about?"" </br>"	Su-:Su-
then the elfin girls had to dance, first in the usual way, and then with stamping feet, which they performed very well; then followed the artistic and solo dance. </br>	N:N
"at this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out, ""throw the rascal up here!"" </br>"	F:F
the poor old minister tried his very best, but he could see nothing, for there was nothing to be seen. </br>	Su-:N
once upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their rank --kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons, and knights. </br>	N:N
but hunca munca had a frugal mind. </br>	N:N
these are three stories you see, three leaves on the same stalk. </br>	N:N
she went right upstairs and looked into the attics, but she could not find him anywhere. </br>	N:N
he put some sticking plaster on his fingers, and his friends both came to dinner. </br>	N:N
mrs. tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were hairpins sticking wrong end out; so that lucie didn't like to sit too near her. </br>	D:N
"this is very beautiful, exclaimed all who saw it, and he who had brought the artificial bird received the title of ""imperial nightingale-bringer-in-chief."" </br>"	N:N
out in the sailors' quarter they give her a better name; there she is called elder-tree mother. </br>	N:N
there were many unpleasant things lying about that had much better have been buried; rabbit bones and skulls, and chickens' legs and other horrors. </br>	N:F
brother, let you and i go to church, as your father and anastasia's father once did. </br>	H:N
again years passed away; not many, but they seemed long years to ib. </br>	N:N
the old house was still standing as in olden times, but the garden had been greatly altered; a pathway led through a portion of the ground, and outside the garden, and beyond the path, stood the old apple-tree, which he had not broken down, although he talked of doing so in his trouble. </br>	N:N
"the princess asked what she meant, and she said, ""let me speak with the bridegroom this night in his chamber, and i will give thee the dress."" </br>"	N:N
and all the children out of the lane- yes, even out of the little lane at the back- flocked to the place, and each gave a button. </br>	N:N
the sausage started in search of wood, the bird made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. </br>	N:N
so she tried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too short, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself down and went to sleep. </br>	H:N
this, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the princess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. </br>	N:H
far down in the forest, where the warm sun and the fresh air made a sweet resting-place, grew a pretty little fir-tree; and yet it was not happy, it wished so much to be tall like its companions- the pines and firs which grew around it. </br>	Sa:Sa
there they all lay, but quite faded; much more so than the day before. </br>	N:N
hem, hem! said he, sitting down on a bench; his thoughts were very elastic, and his heart softened strangely. </br>	N:N
"away, away!"" </br>"	N:N
"get away; don't come so near me, said the garter, ""you appear to me quite like a man."" </br>"	A:N
i shall have to fetch beer and spirits for the journeymen, and they will call me 'thou,' which will be an insult. </br>	N:N
"have you not often seen that when the wind blows they nod at one another, and rustle all their green leaves?"" </br>"	N:N
then she rolled the other cheese after it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. </br>	N:N
"the wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew nigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, ""always be a good girl, and i will look down from heaven and watch over you."" </br>"	N:Sa
they were both arrogant, but which of the two rendered most service? </br>	N:N
it was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall birches. </br>	H:N
then he settled himself cross- legged and arranged his fishing tackle. </br>	N:N
she danced round the church corner, for she could not stop; the coachman had to run after her and seize her. </br>	N:N
a lucky hit! said he, as he called to his servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was there, and bring him away one of the finest flowers. </br>	H:H
someone with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and them locked it. </br>	N:N
"and the lord said to him, ""will you wish for a new house instead of this old one?"" </br>"	N:N
he walked about in a coat embroidered all over, and in the drawing-rooms of society looked just like one of those rich pearl-embroidered bell-pulls, which are only made for show; and behind them always hangs a good thick cord for use. </br>	N:N
i will stay with you, my dear creature, said the little boy. </br>	H:N
the man from the forest stood before it, began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished. </br>	H:N
i do not know where your house is, she answered. </br>	N:N
it is different with the tree; it is obliged to keep awake through three seasons of the year, and does not get any sleep till winter comes. </br>	N:N
yes, he was certainly born to be a drummer. </br>	N:N
and the shirt collar came to this at last. </br>	N:N
no, instead of wishing he kept twisting about, yet did not stir from the spot. </br>	N:N
but the doctor sat still and opened his a b c book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and looked for the cock. </br>	N:N
thus it is with proud silly people, who think themselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice. </br>	N:N
"then the youth said, ""i have eaten my fill, have received some boxes on the ears, but i have given some in return."" </br>"	N:N
well i never did! </br>	Su-:N
here, however, there was more to look at and to admire. </br>	N:N
"nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said: ""do not cry, gretel, go to sleep quietly, the good god will help us."" </br>"	Sa:H
"and the beautiful young lady fell upon her knees before him, and said, ""o dearest huntsman! forgive me all the ill i have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was against my will, for i always loved you very much. </br>"	Sa:Sa
but it is not so easy to find out if one does not know. </br>	F:N
if they were only plucked a little they would look no better than the rest of us. </br>	D:N
every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild beasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. </br>	N:N
i will have ten kisses from the princess, said the swineherd. </br>	N:N
"the mother sits alone there in the prison small, o king of royal blood, these are thy children all.

oh, what bitter tears she shed! and she could not open her heart to any one for relief. </br>	Sa:Sa
one of them had a cap on her head of two colors. </br>	N:N
so the woman was obliged to bring out the wine also, which she had hidden, and the farmer drank it till he became quite merry. </br>	H:H
how did you get all this money? asked great claus, staring with wide open eyes at his neighbor's treasures. </br>	N:Su-
the queen went home quite delighted, and thought she had got rid of her step-children, but the girl had not run out with her brothers, and the queen knew nothing about her. </br>	H:H
he went to the best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord furnish him a room as handsome as possible. </br>	H:N
"you, said the prince, ""have broken his cruel charm, and now i have nothing to wish for but that you should go with me into my father""s kingdom, where i will marry you, and love you as long as you live."" </br>"	H:H

in this way a whole year passed; and then one night she vanished again, and was not to be found. </br>	N:N
which way did she go, moppet? </br>	N:N
why yes, something of the kind, he replied; and so each believed the other to be very valuable, and then they began to talk about the world, and the conceited people in it. </br>	N:N
"at night when he was going to drive the herd home again, he said to the calf: ""if you can stand there and eat your fill, you can also go on your four legs; i don""t care to drag you home again in my arms."" </br>"	A:N

"once on a time when he was riding forth from his castle with his huntsmen, three girls were watching their cows upon the mountain, and when they saw the king with all his followers, the eldest girl pointed to him, and called to the two other girls, ""if i do not get that one, i will have none."" </br>"	N:N
the ladies danced and clapped their hands for joy. </br>	H:H
alfred decided to take a bust of kaela as well as of her mother. </br>	N:N
the maid heard someone standing at the housedoor, knocking. </br>	N:N
the bailiff was willing to give him whatsoever he demanded, but it was of no use, the head-servant said no to everything. </br>	N:N
"but, wife, said the fisherman, ""how can you be king--the fish cannot make you a king?"" </br>"	N:N
they floated on swiftly, for the tide was in their favor, passing over lakes, formed by the stream in its course; sometimes they seemed quite enclosed by reeds and water-plants, yet there was always room for them to pass out, although the old trees overhung the water and the old oaks stretched out their bare branches, as if they had turned up their sleeves and wished to show their knotty, naked arms. </br>	H:N
"a soldier came marching along the high road: ""left, right- left, right."" </br>"	N:N
the one sang and wrote joyously of everything that god had created, and how it was mirrored in his heart. </br>	N:N
the boy to whom he spoke was no other than the son of a poor washer-woman, who was just going past the house. </br>	N:N
the bottle saw it all from the basket in which he lay close to a live rabbit. </br>	N:N
i will make it too small for mr. jackson! </br>	A:N
after this he went back to the forest to rest himself in his trunk. </br>	N:N
first he tried the pollard willow, but it was damp; and the otters had left a dead fish near it. </br>	N:N
it was her eldest child, also a little christina, whom ib had followed to her home, where she suffered hunger and poverty with her mother. </br>	N:N
"at last, however, his wise men said, ""this will not do; the king must marry again, that we may have a queen."" </br>"	N:A
master clerk, said a servant who entered with some papers. </br>	N:N
the lordly life had changed to a life of penury. </br>	N:N
what kind of condition is it? asked the king. </br>	F:N
when the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and all the beasts of the forest, one after the other. </br>	N:N
"where do you go every afternoon by yourself, jemima puddle-duck?"" </br>"	N:N
"but her mother said, ""it is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame"": and off she went with her two daughters to the ball. </br>"	D:D
"with all my heart, he answered, ""i will go and offer it to him;"" and he went to the stranger and invited him, if he had no objection, to sleep in their bed and rest his limbs properly. </br>"	H:N
his clothes were very dirty; and as he slept in the daytime, he always went to bed in his boots. </br>	N:N
"you might know i should think of it, answered the hair brush; ""i am engaged to the boot-jack."" </br>"	N:N
the flowers did hang their heads, because they had been dancing all night, and were very tired, and most likely they were ill. </br>	N:N
"that was a terrible affair!"" said a hen, and in a quarter of the town, too, where it had not taken place. </br>"	D:N
the sun rose while they were crossing the moor, a dazzle of light over the tops of the hills. </br>	N:N
but the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them, and disclosed the project. </br>	F:N
on our arrival, we entered a church, in which there were beautiful pictures in golden frames. </br>	N:N
"he doesn't say ""please."" </br>"	N:N
he spoke very excitedly, saying that their evil propensities would not be destroyed, nor would the fire be extinguished, and they should never find rest. </br>	A:A
holger danske and the old coat of arms; it seems to me as if i have seen the face somewhere. </br>	N:N
"good, said the soldier; ""then in the first place help me out of this well."" </br>"	H:N
and his mother held him in her arms; she kissed his lips, his forehead, and his red hair. </br>	H:N
they went back to the front of the house, and tried in every way to move the bolt of the kitchen window. </br>	N:N
every one who visits florence can very quickly find the place; he has only to ask the first beggar he meets for the metal pig, and he will be told where it is. </br>	N:N
bring me some money, said he to the dog. </br>	N:N
and yet he was the son of a royal plate-washer; but all that he had learned in half a lifetime, peter learned in half a year. </br>	N:N
"thank you, thank you, thank you, mrs. tittlemouse!

and they went themselves, and the lord commanded hansel to let death come down. </br>	N:N
he showed them colored plates of naples, and spoke of excursions to mount vesuvius, and the eruptions of fire from it. </br>	N:N
then she just nodded her head a little. </br>	N:N
here fell a leaf and there fell a leaf. </br>	N:N
"i spoke about it to an earth-worm of my acquaintance, said a third lizard; ""the earth-worm had just come from the elfin hill, where he has been groping about in the earth day and night. </br>"	N:N
in the window-sill stood a myrtle in a pot, and this had been pushed a little on one side, that it might not fall out; for the old maid was leaning out of the window, that she might see. </br>	N:N

the wolf greeted her, and said: </br>	N:N

"immediately the hair fell down and the king""s son climbed up. </br>"	N:N
and now here she was in the cold, and not dressed. </br>	N:N
their hair gleamed golden in the sunshine, lovely to behold; but the real sunshine was more beautiful still. </br>	N:N
"i shall be obliged to go back to the king's new market, said he, ""where there are plenty of carriages standing, or i shall never reach christian's haven."" </br>"	N:N
i feel as if the whole house were in flames! </br>	F:F
they came straight towards the little daisy, which could not understand what they wanted. </br>	N:N
only half a quartern, stammered the boy in a frightened voice. </br>	F:N
whose are these beautiful green meadows? said she. </br>	Su+:N
she found him at the smithy. </br>	N:N
"but, said she to him, ""come back to me in the evening; i must shut my door for fear of the rough huntsmen, so knock and say, ""my little sister, let me in!"" that i may know you; and if you do not say that, i shall not open the door."" </br>"	N:N
the messenger of fortune had only transacted a few unimportant matters; for instance, she had preserved a new bonnet from a shower of rain, and obtained for an honest man a bow from a titled nobody, and so on; but she had something extraordinary to relate, after all. </br>	N:N
humpty dumpty lies in the beck, with a white counterpane round his neck, forty doctors and forty wrights, cannot put humpty dumpty to rights! </br>	H:N
they put up the shutters, and left. </br>	N:N
then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the young man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till their hair whistled in the wind. </br>	N:N
you shall see, said the young birds, and then they took such pains and practised so well every day, that at last it was quite a pleasure to see them fly so lightly and prettily. </br>	N:N
"have you heard?
29:29	n:n	n:n	have you heard?

he could not go back to his own home, so he went to a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. </br>	Sa:N
then ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought that now she should go to the ball. </br>	H:H
the earth has been heaped on the coffin, and it is earth only that lies within it. </br>	N:N
so i have inherited from him, not only my good temper, but a habit of going often to the churchyard, which is good, when done in a proper humor; and then also i take in the intelligencer, just as he used to do. </br>	H:N
the wish passed round, and the glasses clashed together till they rang again; while before the town-gate the mail coach stopped with the twelve strange passengers. </br>	N:N
the eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day: but the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was turned into stone as the tablet had foretold. </br>	N:N
and everything was broken, except the mantelpiece and the kitchen fender. </br>	N:N
now we shall hear what happened to them, for this is a true story. </br>	N:N
"i will create a new style of building, and introduce a plan for erecting houses suitable to the climate, with material easily obtained in the country, and thus suit national feeling and the developments of the age, besides building a storey for my own genius."" </br>"	N:N
"then she offered him thistle- down seed--""tiddly, widdly, widdly! </br>"	N:N
there was no one under whose care he could leave little christina; so she was almost always with him in his boat, or playing in the wood among the blossoming heath, or picking the ripe wild berries. </br>	N:N
then a man took it up to remove it, and one of the bees stung him in the hand, so that he let the flower-pot fall, and it was broken to pieces. </br>	N:N
the elder-tree spreads its branches over it, and the cock struts about and scratches for the hens. </br>	N:N
"have you brought anything for me?"" </br>"	N:N
the king mourned, but he did not think that the queen had done this wicked deed, and as he feared that the girl would also be stolen away from him, he wanted to take her away with him. </br>	Sa:Sa
in her darkest hours she ceased to weep, and thought not of the young daughters who were still left to her. </br>	N:Sa
"i have shut them up by a charm between two mountains, said the dwarf, ""because they were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice."" </br>"	N:A
he sought shelter in the church, and shut gate and door behind him. </br>	F:N
but we have the best bird after all, said one, and then they would have the bird sing again, although it was the thirty-fourth time they had listened to the same piece, and even then they had not learnt it, for it was rather difficult. </br>	N:N
and she sat down to rest by a kitchen garden. </br>	N:N

this was how the world treated anne lisbeth's boy, and how could it be otherwise. </br>	N:N
he was diligent and industrious, but employment did him no good. </br>	N:N
peter's claws were worn down; he was outside the tunnel, shuffling sand away. </br>	N:N
she fetched soft soap, and flannel, and a new scrubbing brush from the storeroom. </br>	N:N
"and when he had looked at her for a long time, he said, ""ah, wife! what a fine thing it is to be king! </br>"	H:N

when he had walked for some time, he came to a small farm, and asked the bailiff if he did not require a head-servant. </br>	N:N
the goloshes answered that purpose very well, but his body had to follow, and this was impossible. </br>	N:N
thereupon the king was full of great joy, but he kept the queen hidden in a chamber until the sunday, when the baby was to be christened. </br>	H:H
thick smoke still rose from the ruins, but the rose-bush stood yonder, fresh, blooming, and untouched, every flower and every twig being reflected in the clear water. </br>	N:N
that answered capitally with the policeman's daughter, and she got a husband. </br>	N:N
the woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him what he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. </br>	A:A
so the lord said he was just to take them in, and they themselves would buy something to eat, to which gambling hansel made no objection. </br>	N:N
close to where they stood grew a hazel-bush, covered with beautiful nuts. </br>	N:N
it was a glorious spectacle; but the stomachs of the travellers were empty, their bodies exhausted with fatigue, and all the longings of their heart turned towards a resting-place for the night; but where to find one they knew not. </br>	Sa:N
everything was spruce and neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there were seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses with wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by the wall stood seven little beds. </br>	N:N
the flopsy bunnies followed at a safe distance. </br>	N:N
"and when they came to the third brook the sister heard how it said as it ran, ""who drinks of me will be a roebuck; who drinks of me will be a roebuck."" </br>"	N:N
winter came; and the new year, and indeed many years passed away; until ib was old enough to be confirmed, and, therefore, he went during a whole winter to the clergyman of the nearest village to be prepared. </br>	N:N
that's awfully pretty, said little anna. </br>	H:N
the lime-blossoms, too small, and besides, there was such a large family of them. </br>	N:N
"but the king said, ""that is not true; it was better done than you could do it."" </br>"	D:D
"the wolf thought to himself: ""what a tender young creature! what a nice plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. </br>"	H:H
"'that is quite true,' said the water-bucket; and he made a spring with joy, and splashed some water on the floor.
58:58	n:n	h:n	then the saucepan went on with his story, and the end was as good as the beginning. </br>"	H:H
but the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and they took him prisoner and carried him before the king. </br>	Su-:Su-
he was a beautiful creature, with slender legs, bright, intelligent eyes, and a mane that hung down over his neck like a veil. </br>	N:N
"i can hear nothing in a place like this,"" and he had time enough to think, for days and nights passed and no one came near him, and when at last somebody did come, it was only to put away large boxes in a corner. </br>"	Su-:N
the little boy still sat astride on its back, when he felt something pulling at his clothes. </br>	N:N
the fools played the fool most admirably, and drank mead out of spirit-glasses, which they then flung among the crowd, by whom they were caught up. </br>	N:N
thou child of perdition, i will yet carry out my purpose! cried the bishop of borglum. </br>	A:A
the parapet projects so far forward that no one can see out of our windows what is going on in that direction. </br>	N:N
"pig-wig put back the sticky peppermints into her pocket; ""sing something,"" she demanded. </br>"	N:N
but nobody ever answers! </br>	N:N
and can i not obtain rest in the grave for you? </br>	Su-:N
he stood erect, and held high in the air the brittle glass that contained his costly treasure. </br>	N:N
we wandered silently homeward across the mountains. </br>	N:N
that must be wonderful cloth, thought the emperor. </br>	Su+:N
the sun shone; and although they had a little rain too, that was good for the farmer; and when they got wetted thoroughly, they only thought what a blessing it was for the country. </br>	N:N
but when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still, and sang: </br>	N:N
it was too late; a surgeon had been sent for to open a vein in her arm, but the poor woman was dead. </br>	N:N
"hei, houp! that was a ride!
31:31	h:h	h:h	here i come! shouted jack the dullard, and he sang till his voice echoed far and wide. </br>"	N:H
therefore they let him go alone; and as he walked on, the solitude of the wood produced a feeling of reverence in his breast; but still he heard the little bell about which the others rejoiced, and sometimes, when the wind blew in that direction, he could hear the sounds from the confectioner's stall, where the others were singing at tea. </br>	N:H
the king's son often stood still and listened; sometimes he thought that the sound of the bell rose up to him out of one of these deep lakes, but soon he found that this was a mistake, and that the bell was ringing still farther in the wood. </br>	N:N
truly, this is the way of mankind. </br>	N:N
the swineherd went behind a tree, wiped his face, threw off his poor attire and stepped forth in his princely garments; he looked so beautiful that the princess could not help bowing to him. </br>	N:N
i am going to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning some art or trade, answered he. </br>	N:N
it happened as a punishment to him, for having boasted so shockingly of things which were not true. </br>	N:N
garden plant! he said to the cucumber, and in that one word his deep learning showed itself, and it forgot that he was pecking at her and eating it up. </br>	Su+:N
the cat asked him if he would like to see her horses? </br>	N:N
the poor people in the town, and still more the strangers, were continually making mistakes in the people they wanted to see; nor was this to be avoided, when they went according to the shields that were hung up. </br>	N:N
who does that stand for? thought he, and then came another and another. </br>	N:N
"then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: ""scour the whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all three."" </br>"	F:F
that is a dangerous woman, said the old goblin; and the two sons walked out of the hill; they had had enough of it. </br>	D:N
the singing-bird soared away, over mountain and valley, over field and wood- he was the bird of popular song, who never dies. </br>	N:N
"do you see how she swallows the peas?
137:137	d:n	d:a	she eats too many, and the best ones too.
138:138	n:n	n:n	curoo!
139:139	n:n	n:n	curoo!
140:140	d:n	d:d	how she lifts her crest, the ugly, spiteful creature!
141:141	n:n	n:n	curoo!
142:142	n:n	n:n	curoo! </br>"	N:N
whenever he dozed, he dreamed that he had lost one or another of these possessions; then he would awake with a start, and the first movements of his hand formed a triangle from his right-hand pocket to his breast, and from his breast to his left-hand pocket, to feel whether they were all safe. </br>	N:N
"that is queer, indeed, said the other; ""let us follow the cart, and see where it goes."" </br>"	Su-:Su-
"then he said, ""if i ring, you must draw me up again immediately."" </br>"	N:N
tom thumb and hunca munca went upstairs and peeped into the dining-room. </br>	N:N
"but the youth said: ""however difficult it may be, i will learn it. </br>"	Sa:N
mrs. tittlemouse followed him with a dishcloth, to wipe his large wet footmarks off the parlor floor. </br>	N:N
take likewise a glass of water out of the fountain, and with these two things go back by the same way. </br>	N:N
now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs came to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and bark. </br>	N:N
duchess started! </br>	Su-:Su-
"a beauty ought to be perfect, and kaela was a perfect beauty."" </br>"	N:N
"he led him into the king""s cellar, and the man bent over the huge barrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was out he had emptied all the barrels. </br>"	H:N
and again little tuk lay in his bed, scarcely knowing whether he was dreaming or not, for some one stood by him. </br>	F:N
the student's turn came to watch. </br>	N:N
presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees on each side as they passed. </br>	N:N
oh, it was very beautiful! </br>	H:N
"but when she was outside, the three little men said to each other, ""what shall we give her as she is so good, and has shared her bread with us?"" </br>"	N:N
i seek for my brothers, the seven ravens, answered she. </br>	N:N
the youth who knew the dictionary and newspaper by heart had a black horse, and he who knew all about the corporation laws received a milk-white steed. </br>	N:N
wonderful! cried the farmer, starting up and opening the oven door; and there lay all the nice things hidden by the farmer's wife, but which he supposed had been conjured there by the wizard under the table. </br>	Su+:N
"yes, he continued, ""these people were among the last who were buried in the churchyard of the old convent. </br>"	N:N
after finishing breakfast at his leisure, pigling had a look round the cottage; everything was locked up. </br>	N:N
"to repeat it all would require years and days; for year by year it is telling the old stories, sometimes short ones, sometimes long ones, according to its whim; it tells of old times, of the dark hard times, thus: ""in the church of st. alban, the monk had mounted up into the tower. </br>"	N:N
the brother got up and took the little sister by the hand, and they set off to find the brook. </br>	N:N
it was not the weather for flying about in summer clothes; but fortunately the butterfly was not out in it. </br>	N:N
his wings were dry now, so they carried him to a great distance, till at last he reached a hothouse, where a sash of the glass roof was partly open, so he quietly slipped in and buried himself in the warm earth. </br>	N:N
"hans answered: ""to gretel."" </br>"	N:N
i mean to be somebody, and do something useful in the world, said the eldest of five brothers. </br>	N:N
"so lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone, and then the cook said: ""early tomorrow morning, when the forester is out hunting, i will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the kettle, i will throw in fundevogel, and will boil him in it."" </br>"	D:Su-
that is a reward for your industry, said mother holle, and as she spoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well. </br>	N:N
the servant maid and the little boy went down stairs directly to look for him; but he was nowhere to be seen, although once they nearly trod upon him. </br>	N:N
away went the horse full gallop; and before hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his back by the road-side. </br>	Su-:Su-
i don't understand your outlandish talk, he cried at last, angrily turning his back upon them. </br>	A:A
on the evening before the day he had settled to return with the captain of the passage-boat, ib lost himself in the streets, and took quite a different turning to the one he wished to follow. </br>	N:N
the sun shone, and the showers watered it; and this was just as good for the flax as it is for little children to be washed and then kissed by their mother. </br>	N:N
thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. </br>	Sa:Sa
oh, that's too 'witty!' </br>	N:N
"i don't want to be disgusted, he said to himself, ""and yet i can't help it."" </br>"	D:D
"now you shall also see my little earwigs, said a third and a fourth mother, ""they are lovely little things, and highly amusing. </br>"	H:N
"if we care to sing in tune, we may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us."" </br>"	N:H
the better to eat you with! </br>	N:N
now go on, said he. </br>	Su+:N
but the king was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking another wife. </br>	Sa:Sa
everything on the earth is hidden away, only the golden cross of the church, the symbol of faith, arises over the snow grave, and gleams in the blue air and in the bright sunshine. </br>	N:N
sometimes, in winter, when the snow lay white and glittering on the ground, a hare would come springing along, and jump right over the little tree; and then how mortified it would feel! </br>	Sa:F
i jumped highest, after all, said the flea. </br>	A:N
she stayed there awhile, and looked at everything in amazement; then she touched the light a little with her finger, and her finger became quite golden. </br>	Su+:N
and therefore she does many a good deed, thinks of all in the humble cottages and in the rich mansions, where there are also afflicted ones. </br>	H:N
"he is still alive, said the huntsman; ""and i am glad that i had pity on him, but let him go in peace, and brought home his royal coat."" </br>"	H:H
he bowed his head over it and kissed it, old, thrown away, and cracked as it was, and standing there amidst the grass and nettles. </br>	H:N
on a beautiful sunny autumn day- one could almost have believed it was still the middle of summer- there hopped about in the dry clean-swept courtyard before the principal entrance of the hall a number of black, white, and gaily-coloured pigeons, all shining in the sunlight. </br>	N:N
hearest thou? said the child. </br>	N:N
ah, that is some of your mythologies, said mamma-in-law. </br>	N:N
they broke up the pudding, the lobsters, the pears and the oranges. </br>	N:N
you shall tell your tales, for no one over there can do it so well; and we will sit in the stone rooms, where the pine logs are burning, and drink mead out of the golden drinking-horn of the old norwegian kings. </br>	N:N
"we will have some claret, or mead, or bremen beer, said one of the guests; ""will you drink with us?"" </br>"	N:N
the soldier consented, and next day laboured with all his strength, but could not finish it by the evening. </br>	F:N
such were anthony's thoughts as he stood under the tree, and during many a long night as he lay in his lonely chamber in the wooden house in hauschen street, copenhagen, in the foreign land to which the rich merchant of bremen, his employer, had sent him on condition that he should never marry. </br>	N:N
"mother, now the bells of heaven are ringing, said the child; ""mother, the sun is going to rise."" </br>"	N:N
yes, i have had great experience of this kind, but my greatest grief was for the garter- the girdle i meant to say- that jumped into the wash-tub. </br>	N:Sa
your sister anastasia is the most beautiful and most innocent of maidens, and she shall consecrate the deed. </br>	H:N
mrs. tittlemouse went on her way to a distant storeroom, to fetch cherrystones and thistle- down seed for dinner. </br>	N:N
"but thou canst not return to earth, and i can do nothing for thee."" </br>"	D:N
"so she called all seven to her and said: ""dear children, i have to go into the forest, be on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you all--skin, hair, and everything. </br>"	N:F
a light arises within us, and then forgotten things make themselves remembered; and thus it was with anne lisbeth. </br>	N:N
when the gnat had heard that, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest detail, to the willow-wren. </br>	Su+:N
"you must not look only on the sorrowful side, said the little boy; ""i think everything in this house is beautiful, and all the old pleasant thoughts come back here to pay visits."" </br>"	N:N
so the soldier now threw away all the silver money he had taken, and filled his pockets and his knapsack with gold instead; and not only his pockets and his knapsack, but even his cap and boots, so that he could scarcely walk. </br>	N:N
it is such a distance! </br>	N:N
a shepherd had a faithful dog, called sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth. </br>	N:N
at the other end of the table was a partly unfolded tablecloth, a plate, a tumbler, a knife and fork, salt cellar, mustard and a chair-- in short, preparations for one person's supper. </br>	N:N
good day, hans, what good thing do you bring? </br>	H:N
in heaven with the eternal god, it can be imagined, and it is possible, sounded the reply through the air. </br>	N:N
"this is surely, thought he, ""an old village schoolmaster, a perfect original, such as one meets with sometimes even in jutland."" </br>"	N:N
besides, who knows? </br>	N:N
they are molly and me, said the boy. </br>	H:N
the second did not want to go in at all, but was forced. </br>	F:F
a little way off, on the edge of the roof, stood the father stork, quite upright and stiff; not liking to be quite idle, he drew up one leg, and stood on the other, so still that it seemed almost as if he were carved in wood. </br>	N:N
anne lisbeth was in a fever. </br>	N:N
they buzzed round the prince and stung his face and hands; angrily he drew his sword and brandished it, but he only touched the air and did not hit the gnats. </br>	A:A
yes, if you have any money. </br>	N:N
it was really a wonderful light. </br>	H:N
but she told them how happy she was, and stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood. </br>	H:H
his stories were as strange as the legends of the priests of olden times. </br>	N:N
but snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years old she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself. </br>	H:N
hans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it, threw it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. </br>	N:H
crows and magpies fluttered about them, and cried, as if in contempt, 'caw, caw, turned out of our nest- caw, caw,' as they had done in the wood at borreby, when the trees were felled. </br>	N:N
"then dummling said: ""father, do let me go and cut wood."" </br>"	Sa:N
one shooting star after another traversed the sky. </br>	N:N
the warm beer had strengthened her, and the smell of the good food had been pleasant to her. </br>	H:N
then he waited till her father came home, and told him that the unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the pigeon-house. </br>	N:N
he could exist here, he said, well enough. </br>	N:H
when the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked round for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. </br>	N:Su-
"a house full, a hole full!
27:27	n:n	n:n	and you cannot gather a bowl-full! </br>"	N:N
that he had done, and had started again in his wooden shoes and old clothes, for the sound of the bell was too enticing- he felt he must go on. </br>	N:N
there is something for thee to eat, said he to him, and then went his way. </br>	N:N
she laid her kerchief over me, and took my bones that they might lie </br>	N:N
"tin soldier, said the goblin, ""don't wish for what does not belong to you. </br>"	A:N
"the cat goes up the stairs trip, trap, the door she knocks at tap, tap, tap, ""mistress fox, are you inside?"" </br>"	N:N
i brought you there because i really loved you. </br>	H:H
"the soldier saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them; but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest princess, and she cried out to her sisters, ""all is not right; someone took hold of my gown."" </br>"	F:F
"then the man in the tree answered, ""lift up thine eyes, for behold here i sit in the sack of wisdom; here have i, in a short time, learned great and wondrous things. </br>"	N:H
he knew not the names of these birds, nor where they had flown, but he felt towards them as he had never felt for any other bird in the world. </br>	N:N
"no, i am unable to imagine that, although you say so."" </br>"	Su-:N
the old grandfather told the little boy a great deal about danish men and women who had distinguished themselves in olden times, so that he fancied he knew as much even as holger danske himself, who, after all, could only dream; and when the little fellow went to bed, he thought so much about it that he actually pressed his chin against the counterpane, and imagined that he had a long beard which had become rooted to it. </br>	N:N
close by sat an old king with a golden crown on his white head. </br>	N:N
so she ordered the servant to bring the seventh horse, and when the miller saw it, he said that such a horse as that had never yet entered his yard. </br>	Su+:Su+
the servant ran after his master and told him what had happened, but would not leave his saddle behind him, and ran back to fetch it. </br>	Su-:N
one day there came to our hut franks, men from a far country, whose dress was different to ours. </br>	N:N
"o, you fool! said she, ""then we must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our coffins,"" and she left him no peace until he consented. </br>"	A:A
and now they were in franconia. </br>	N:N
he put the ham in the middle of the floor, and hit it with the tongs and with the shovel--bang, bang, smash, smash! </br>	N:N
then he asked his wife for more pudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table. </br>	N:N
then the cloak was removed, and she found herself in a large hall, of wide-spreading dimensions, in which there was a subdued light, like twilight, reigning, and in a moment her child appeared before her, smiling, and more beautiful than ever; with a silent cry she pressed him to her heart. </br>	Su+:H
the fingers then placed the point of the needle against the cook's slipper. </br>	N:N
they were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right, wherever his legs took him. </br>	F:N
all on our way a visit to pay to mr korbes, the fox, today. </br>	N:N
the paper boat rocked up and down, and turned itself round sometimes so quickly that the tin soldier trembled; yet he remained firm; his countenance did not change; he looked straight before him, and shouldered his musket. </br>	F:N
"thou borglum bishop, he exclaims, ""i shall subdue thee after all! </br>"	A:N
he set down the pipkin of milk upon the dresser, and looked suspiciously at the tea-cups. </br>	Su-:N
in winter and early spring he might generally be found in an earth amongst the rocks at the top of bull banks, under oatmeal crag. </br>	N:N
"the father sighed, and answered him: ""you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that."" </br>"	A:N
the cat looked up and saw old mr. benjamin bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace. </br>	N:N
on this they would not let him go. </br>	N:N
the body fell forward, and lay at full length on the ground as one dead. </br>	N:N
and then the living, mamma, said kaela. </br>	N:D
a louse and a flea kept house together and were brewing beer in an egg-shell. </br>	N:N
"when she had done eating, they said, ""there is a broom for thee, sweep all clean for us outside by the back-door."" </br>"	N:N
the little drummer still kept his healthy color; he had suffered no damage; he looked cheerfully at the dog of the regiment, which was jumping along as merrily as if the whole thing had been got up for his amusement, and as if the bullets were only flying about that he might have a game of play with them. </br>	N:H
but then the poor miserable creature could not see. </br>	N:N
"in fact, this memory of the soul is a fearful thing; every sin, every sinful thought it can bring back, and we may well ask how we are to give account of ""every idle word"" that may have been whispered in the heart or uttered with the lips. </br>"	N:N
hollow places were cut in the walls, in which stood vases of transparent glass which were filled with colored spirit or with a bluish vapour. </br>	N:N
"so gambling hansel went, but when he reached the house where the other gambling vagabonds were gathered together, they, although they had won all that he had, greeted him clamorously, and said, ""hansel, do come in."" </br>"	N:N
the room had the appearance of a dutch interior. </br>	N:N
then he saw everything which was happening on earth, and observed an ugly old woman who was standing washing by the side of a stream, secretly laying two veils on one side for herself. </br>	N:N
about midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed mightily delighted. </br>	H:H
the young storks performed their part so well that they received a mark of honor, with frogs and snakes as a present. </br>	N:N
listen to the story of jemima puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs. </br>	A:A
"the tree first recovered itself while being unpacked in the courtyard of a house, with several other trees; and it heard a man say, ""we only want one, and this is the prettiest."" </br>"	N:N
"oh! exclaimed the shirt-collar, ""what a first-rate dancer you would make; you can stretch out your leg so well. </br>"	H:N
he was a director of a theatre, a manager of masked balls, and a leader of all the amusements we can imagine. </br>	N:N
the child still sat, in the stiffness of death, holding the matches in her hand, one bundle of which was burnt. </br>	N:N
round this plate were wreaths of flowers with their stems in the water, and upon it floated a large tulip-leaf, which served tiny for a boat. </br>	N:N
"hallo! cried one, as he pricked himself with the darning-needle, ""here's a fellow for you."" </br>"	Su-:N
pigling squealed; then ran back frantically, hoping to overtake alexander and the policeman. </br>	Su+:H
is mrs fox not at home? </br>	N:Su-
"she said, ""his brother made all the stone and bricks, and sent them to me to build my poor little dwelling, which was a great deal to do for a poor woman like me. </br>"	F:N
"so she did as the old woman told her, and set herself at the window, and looked about the country and seemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, ""what makes you so sad?"" </br>"	Su-:Sa
delaying is not forgetting! </br>	N:N
then he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path; while hans went on the way homewards free from care. </br>	H:H
"soon after this, little marleen came up to her mother who was stirring a pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, ""mother, brother is sitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale; and when i asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that frightened me."" </br>"	F:F
what has a woman to do with rule? said the bishop. </br>	D:N
as she turned to walk away, much came into her mind that she had heard in her childhood: old superstitions of spectres by the sea-shore; of the ghosts of drowned but unburied people, whose corpses had been washed up on the desolate beach. </br>	N:F
"the emperor and all his barons then came to the hall; the swindlers held their arms up as if they held something in their hands and said: ""these are the trousers!"" </br>"	H:N

when evening came, and the house door stood open, he slipped out. </br>	N:N
the maid replied: </br>	N:N
near the coffin stood a table on which were four candles, four loaves of bread, and four bottles of wine, and when this provision came to an end, he would have to die of hunger. </br>	N:N
it might be said of a tree, as it has been said of some men- it was not predicted at his cradle that he should come to this. </br>	N:N
"i am a poor tailor, he answered, ""whom night has surprised here in the wilderness, and i earnestly beg you to take me into your hut until morning."" </br>"	N:Su-
"ah! is that so?
27:27	h:n	h:n	indeed! said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking curiously at jemima. </br>"	N:N
now, have you got nothing to say? said one of the swindlers, while he pretended to be busily weaving. </br>	N:N
there is really nothing in the world that can be compared to red shoes! </br>	N:N
"i will come every evening to see if you have obeyed my order."" </br>"	N:N
here lies a maiden of another description. </br>	N:N
"then she was in a great fright, and cried out to chanticleer, ""pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or i shall be choked."" </br>"	F:F
the boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her friend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. </br>	N:N
it was most kind to timmy tiptoes; it lent him its nightcap; and the house was full of provisions. </br>	N:H
"the children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!"" </br>"	F:A
the servant, who cleaned his boots, thought they certainly were a shabby pair to be worn by such a rich gentleman, for he had not yet bought any new ones. </br>	N:N
my darling, this is only a dream. </br>	N:N
"at last the third also came with the like intent, and the others screamed out: ""keep away; for goodness"" sake keep away!"" </br>"	A:F
one morning a little rabbit sat on a bank. </br>	N:N
they only bowed to one another; they did not speak, because they were going to have a party. </br>	N:N
and accordingly jack the dullard was made a king, and received a crown and a wife, and sat upon a throne. </br>	N:N
and then what a number of subscriptions to charities, and what innocent verses! </br>	N:Su+
eight days and eight nights she stayed by the well, and experienced no want of provisions. </br>	N:N
there she stood, in full dress, while ib wore only his working clothes. </br>	N:N
and all those galleries one is expected to see, and the quantity of things you are obliged to run after! </br>	D:D
no one lived there at nights but little brown mice, and they ran in and out without any keys! </br>	N:N
this rose and the nightingale he wished to give to the princess; and therefore both were put into big silver cases and sent to her. </br>	N:N
little red-cap, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her. </br>	N:N
a whole life drama is unfolding itself before her inward gaze. </br>	N:N
but their father, the old goblin, was very different; he talked pleasantly about the stately norwegian rocks, and told fine tales of the waterfalls which dashed over them with a clattering noise like thunder or the sound of an organ, spreading their white foam on every side. </br>	N:N
it was in a room heated by a stove, and as warm as summer. </br>	N:N
the whole bundle of paper had been placed on the fire, and was soon alight. </br>	N:N
he will never be good for anything as long as he lives! </br>	A:N
ribby and tabitha looked at one another. </br>	N:N
"pride, said the dead woman; ""do you see him?"" </br>"	N:N
"it is a horrible story: i will not keep it to myself, but let it go farther."" </br>"	D:N
he bowed himself before bishop and monk; but when he offended the free peasants with heavy taxes and hard words, they seized their weapons and put him to flight like a wild beast. </br>	N:N
"have you never thought of being engaged?"" </br>"	N:N
"ah! said he, ""she wants to be lord of the sun and moon."" </br>"	N:N
here they remained, and the angel hovered over a small, narrow street, in which lay a large heap of straw, ashes, and sweepings from the houses of people who had removed. </br>	N:N
they were pardoned and forgiven, although they really had both done wrong, and deserved to get into trouble; first, because they had let the sucking-pig fall into the water; and, secondly, because they had run away. </br>	N:N
aha, it has allies, quoth the fowl. </br>	Su-:N
oh how funny! said ida, and she laughed. </br>	H:H
when she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had happened. </br>	N:Su-
"no, said the other, ""that is not an honest calling, and what can one look to earn by it in the end but the gallows?"" </br>"	D:A
he had food, and he could also do something towards earning his living; he took care of mary's red cow, for he knew how to tend cattle and make himself useful. </br>	N:N
what are those funny little white things? </br>	N:N
"he answered: ""ah, lord, i cannot; i have a bad sore place on my head."" </br>"	F:N
that will avail him little, said the bishop. </br>	D:N
here you will find another dog, with eyes as big as mill-wheels; but do not let that trouble you. </br>	N:N
"it is very uncomfortable, i am afraid i shall be summoned.
29:29	sa:n	s:n	i have tried in vain to get a license upon credit at the post office; said pickles. </br>"	F:N
in the evening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for her little feet would carry her no further. </br>	F:N
he lifted her up, and taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the night. </br>	H:N
so it happened that little claus received another bushel of money, and the landlord buried his old grandmother as if she had been his own. </br>	N:N
at last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. </br>	Su+:H
god knows. </br>	N:N
"'shall i be crowned now?' asked the fire-tongs; so the broom found another wreath for the tongs.
63:63	d:n	d:h	'they were only common people after all,' thought the matches. </br>"	N:N
he told, too, how he had heard from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to break through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and died. </br>	N:N
"i missed my wife and the little ones, who are always ready to smother me with kisses."" </br>"	N:N
"i know it, said the angel, ""because i myself was the poor sick boy who walked upon crutches, and i know my own flower well."" </br>"	H:N
and as he returned no answer, it said, </br>	N:N
when she had already spent a long time there it came to pass that the king of the country was hunting in the forest, and his huntsmen came to the tree on which the maiden was sitting. </br>	N:N
"old mr. b!
21:21	h:n	n:n	riddle-me-ree!
22:22	h:n	n:n	hitty pitty within the wall, hitty pitty without the wall; if you touch hitty pitty, hitty pitty will bite you! </br>"	H:N
"may we ask you to step down into this rich mud, you must be fatigued after your journey."" </br>"	N:N
he took it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. </br>	N:N
"when he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was greatly grieved, and said to himself, ""i will remain here and wait for her,"" so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for a whole year, and every day he saw the king""s daughter driving round her castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her. </br>"	Sa:Sa
then some frogs began to croak in the marsh. </br>	N:N
it was certainly more than a quarter of an hour before the daisy recovered its senses. </br>	N:N
involuntarily he seized one of the nearest flowers; it was a little, simple daisy. </br>	N:N
then it was carried down stairs and taken into the courtyard so quickly, that it forgot to think of itself, and could only look about, there was so much to be seen. </br>	N:N
thereupon dummling asked to have her for his wife; but the king did not like the son-inlaw, and made all manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink a cellarful of wine. </br>	F:N
"learn what you will, spoke the father, ""it is all the same to me. </br>"	A:N
can i too fetch some of it? said the king; and he was quite eager about it. </br>	H:N
the other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes. </br>	F:N
she sought her children, but they were nowhere to be found. </br>	N:N
then when the king in his grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. </br>	Sa:Sa
here it is, said the king, when they came to the first door with a cross on it. </br>	N:N
at last he felt convinced, in his own mind, that he really had one, and was so delighted that he positively died of joy at the thought of having at last caught an idea. </br>	N:H
heaven will give me the heart's consolation. </br>	N:N
as he was hungry, and saw the food, he, too, place himself at the table, ate with those who were eating and enjoyed it. </br>	H:H
"when dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train before the king""s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite loudly, and as if she would never stop. </br>"	H:H
"i'm in sad trouble, cousin ribby,"" said tabitha, shedding tears. </br>"	Sa:Sa
"i am king, said ilsabill, ""and you are my slave; so go at once!"" </br>"	A:N
but the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and no one could hold the miser. </br>	A:N
"this she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ""now i am tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed."" </br>"	N:N
"oh! cried the devil, ""what are you doing?"" </br>"	Su-:Su-
"may i be allowed to ask if you are made of gold? she inquired of her neighbor, a pin; ""you have a very pretty appearance, and a curious head, although you are rather small. </br>"	N:N
so they went on, but the road led them out of the way; no house could be seen, it grew dark, and the children were afraid. </br>	F:F
was it in their house, or a neighbor's? </br>	N:N
"what a pretty little wife this would make for my son, said the toad, and she took up the walnut-shell in which little tiny lay asleep, and jumped through the window with it into the garden.
17:17	n:n	n:n	in the swampy margin of a broad stream in the garden lived the toad, with her son.
18:18	n:n	n:s	he was uglier even than his mother, and when he saw the pretty little maiden in her elegant bed, he could only cry, croak, croak, croak."" </br>"	Su-:N
"then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them to let him take her away; but they said, ""we will not part with her for all the gold in the world."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
next they came to some fine meadows. </br>	N:N
"no, no, no!
64:64	f:n	f:n	he's bagged my family--tommy brock--in a sack --have you seen him? </br>"	F:N
"then he sat down by his fire and fell asleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have the fifty talers, and said: ""well do you know how to shudder?"" </br>"	A:N
then she ran out of the village, and no one has seen her since. </br>	F:N
timmy tiptoes grew fatter and fatter! </br>	N:N
half way up, cottontail was sitting in her doorway, with four or five half- grown little rabbits playing about her; one black and the others brown. </br>	N:N
rapunzel, rapunzel, let down your hair to me. </br>	N:N
it was in a large house with dark windows and empty rooms, in which a peculiar stillness reigned. </br>	N:N
"she is also called ""lady halle,"" as every child round eisenach well knows. </br>"	N:N
"she sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard fate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man hobbled in, and said, ""good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you weeping for?"" </br>"	Sa:Sa
one morning he broke, and sunk down altogether; and, behold, where he had stood, something like a broomstick remained sticking up in the ground. </br>	N:N
and very early every morning-- before anybody is awake--hunca munca comes with her dust-pan and her broom to sweep the dollies' house! </br>	N:N
"oh, what lovely flowers!
61:61	h:n	h:n	yes, it is mouse and bacon! </br>"	H:H
but the two sisters had no children, and once when the king was obliged to go from home he invited them to come to the queen in order to cheer her, for she was about to bear a child. </br>	N:N
"you will see what will come out, she said; ""something you don't expect. </br>"	N:N
"they live too near the rocks to quarrel with their neighbors.
94:94	f:n	f:n	come on, cousin benjamin! </br>"	N:N
what a crowd there would be. </br>	N:N
what is this?- in my own handwriting, too! </br>	Su+:N
one, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits! said mr. mcgregor. </br>	H:N
"give me my crown, said the elf king, ""and let me stand in the moonshine."" </br>"	H:N
and thus eight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his father; and he began to long to see him once again. </br>	Sa:Sa
father of all mercy, grant thou to her the peace that i was unable to procure for her! </br>	F:N
"i will soon find out where she is, however, said the star-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, ""i see her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and i can spy the dragon close by, guarding her."" </br>"	Su+:N
the whole winter the swallow remained underground, and tiny nursed him with care and love. </br>	H:H
did we not hear a roly-poly noise in the attic when we were looking into that chest? </br>	N:N
"as he could not find it immediately he said: ""i know you are there, so you had better come out!"" </br>"	A:A
"then she knew not what to do, and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and said, ""what will you give me to do your task?"" </br>"	Sa:Sa
"i like the boy very well; but the mother is good for nothing."" </br>"	D:N
there were no lamps in the street, excepting a very small one, which hung at one end of the street, before a picture of the virgin, which had been painted on the wall. </br>	N:N
will not the string be very indigestible, anna maria? inquired samuel whiskers. </br>	N:N
then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left there. </br>	F:N
the old man grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad to get into the circle if he could. </br>	H:A
"the little tailor looked round and thought: ""it is much more spacious here than in my workshop."" </br>"	N:N
but this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the half-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her fur mantle over it, and in her haste did not blacken herself all over with soot, but left one of her fingers white. </br>	N:N
"i am the emperor's daughter!
68:68	n:n	n:n	tell him i will give him ten kisses, as i did the other day; the remainder one of my ladies can give him.
69:69	d:n	d:a	but we do not like to kiss him"" said the ladies. </br>"	N:N
well, i haven't got the jewel, said the smallest of the toads; she was as ugly as a toad can be. </br>	N:N
the roses were again reflected; they were very beautiful, but they did not know it, for no one had told them. </br>	N:N
but the rose was faded; only a few dry leaves still clung to the green hedge behind it. </br>	N:N
"i work hard and suffer pain with my poor hands, said she, ""but i do it willingly, that i may be able to bring you up honestly and truthfully, my dear boy."" </br>"	Sa:N
one bell was silent; but it was illuminated by the bright sunshine which streamed from the head and bust of the renowned figure, of which it formed a part. </br>	N:N
after considerable thought, he emptied the water into a wash basin and jug. </br>	N:N
golden shoes for you, indeed! </br>	Su-:N
the frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and as she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three drops of blood fell upon it. </br>	Sa:N
how they would like to know where the sparks all went to! </br>	N:N
he was in east street, as it now appears; he lay with his legs turned towards a porch, and just by him sat the watchman asleep. </br>	N:N
one is born to that, said the cucumber to itself. </br>	N:N
the hymn-book, in which the rose still lay, was placed under her head, for so she had wished it; and then they buried grandmother. </br>	N:N
but all day long his thoughts were in the picture gallery; and so he pricked his fingers and was awkward. </br>	N:N
i have now learnt to despise you, he said. </br>	N:A
why do you want to go to market, pigling? inquired pig-wig. </br>	N:N
as it hung there in the bird's-cage, it could hear the noise and murmur of the people in the street below, as well as the conversation of the old maid in the room within. </br>	N:N
he knew well where little claus's bed stood; so he went right up to it, and struck the old grandmother on the head. thinking it must be little claus. </br>	N:N
"so the little cart said, ""then i will run,"" and began to run wildly. </br>"	N:N
"when he had rested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother""s village. </br>"	N:N
twice in my life had i seen this same thing, and i knew that there would be an awful storm, with a spring tide, which would overwhelm the poor people who were now out on the ice, drinking, dancing, and making merry. </br>	H:N
yes, she is here; here in this sacred hour, replied the angel, pointing to a corner of the room; and there,- where in her life-time, the mother had taken her seat amidst flowers and pictures: in that spot, where she, like the blessed fairy of the house, had welcomed husband, children, and friends, and, like a sunbeam, had spread joy and cheerfulness around her, the centre and heart of them all,- there, in that very spot, sat a strange woman, clothed in long, flowing garments, and occupying the place of the dead wife and mother. </br>	N:N
i could not have wandered about as they do. </br>	N:N
at length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the stables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and no man was to be seen. </br>	N:N
i have a clear perception of everything as if i were wide awake. </br>	N:N
"mother, cried the little boy; ""only hear what i have read."" </br>"	Sa:N
it was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney. </br>	N:N
the sea casts up tubs and barrels filled with costly wine for the convent cellar, and in the convent is already good store of beer and mead. </br>	N:N
it is heard by the sleepless listener in the thickly-walled rooms at borglum. </br>	N:N
seat thyself, and listen to the story of my life: </br>	N:N
"next day the youthful pair started for copenhagen, where they were to live; mamma-in-law accompanied them, to attend to the ""coarse work,"" as she always called the domestic arrangements. </br>"	N:N
longman, the middle finger, looked over the heads of all the others. </br>	N:N
from one shrove tuesday to another, much may occur to weigh down the heart; it is the reckoning of a whole year; much may be forgotten, sins against heaven in word and thought, sins against our neighbor, and against our own conscience. </br>	N:N
but in the churchyard there were several new graves; and there also, in the grass, close by the wall, stood the old church bell! </br>	N:N
no one imagined what beautiful things she had seen, nor into what glory she had entered with her grandmother, on new-year's day. </br>	N:N
for years she had not been able to weep, but had only bitten her lips till the blood started. </br>	N:N
"that is no part of our bargain, said the youth, ""the bench is mine."" </br>"	A:N
see, children, that is the way of the world, said the mother duck, whetting her beak, for she would have liked the eel's head herself. </br>	N:Sa
please yourself, said the old duck, and she went away. </br>	N:N
so at last they set out together, and took with them their little child; and she chose a large hall with thick walls for him to sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted; but, unluckily, no one saw that there was a crack in the door. </br>	N:N
the youth made over his three-legged horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the soldiers. </br>	H:N
it was new year's eve, and the church clock was striking twelve. </br>	N:N
and he spoke of his works, and of his warlike deeds, which his contemporaries had known, but which had not been sung, because there was no singer among his companions. </br>	N:N
the good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening. </br>	Su+:Su+
"i always act with due order, consideration, and calculation.
21:21	n:n	n:n	seven times have i already had the honor to be present at the distribution of the prizes, and to vote; but to-day is the first time i have been able to carry out my will.
22:22	n:n	n:n	i always reckon the first prize by going through the alphabet from the beginning, and the second by going through from the end.
23:23	n:n	n:n	be so kind as to give me your attention, and i will explain to you how i reckon from the beginning.
24:24	n:n	n:n	the eighth letter from a is h, and there we have h for hare; therefore i awarded to the hare the first prize.
25:25	n:n	n:n	the eighth letter from the end of the alphabet is s, and therefore the snail received the second prize.
26:26	n:n	n:n	next year, the letter i will have its turn for the first prize, and the letter r for the second. </br>"	N:N
so they walked off together towards the spot where chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew near it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a house in which a gang of robbers lived. </br>	F:N
"then she whispered to them quite softly, ""i know you are going to a ball to-night."" </br>"	H:N
so on they went till they came to a rapid stream. </br>	N:N
how beautiful it was! said the little boy. </br>	H:N
one story projected a long way over the other, and under the roof ran a leaden gutter, with a dragon's head at the end. </br>	N:N
there grew magnificent oaks and beech-trees; and if the bark was split of any of them, long blades of grass grew out of the clefts; there were also large smooth lakes in the wood, on which the swans were swimming about and flapping their wings. </br>	N:N
they lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. </br>	H:H
then chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts came and wept with him over poor partlet. </br>	Sa:Sa
"if so, you are a true child of fortune."" </br>"	N:Su+
goody tiptoes picked up the nut bags and went home. </br>	N:N
he was the angel of the flower; for a tiny man and a tiny woman dwell in every flower; and this was the king of them all. </br>	N:N
but in order that the king might not see it, she was to lie on the side on which she had no eye. </br>	N:N
but she said she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she could not stay there all day waiting for them. </br>	N:A
"round about, round about, lo and behold!
12:12	n:n	n:n	reel away, reel away, straw into gold! </br>"	N:N
a few days after, there was an auction at the old house, and from his window the little boy saw the people carrying away the pictures of old knights and ladies, the flower-pots with the long ears, the old chairs, and the cup-boards. </br>	N:N
but the more he talked with the boatmen the less they could understand each other. </br>	N:N
the door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. </br>	Sa:N
the water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder and in the back passage. </br>	N:N
"i dont know how that may be,"" said she; ""never is a long time. </br>"	N:N
"merrily the feast i""ll make. </br>"	H:N
now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have liked to have one of its golden feathers. </br>	N:N
they certainly had a very soporific effect upon the flopsy bunnies! </br>	N:N
he was going on a long journey over mountains and seas; it is easy for a man to lose his life in such a journey. </br>	N:N
she seemed, so far as mr. alfred was concerned, to be like a piece of fresh blotting-paper that absorbed all he said and asked for more. </br>	N:N
this restless feeling would be stilled, if i could take a journey far away from this country. </br>	N:N
"then he answered, ""to tell the truth i did not cook it, but cat-skin did."" </br>"	N:N
and the eyes of all sparkled with malice. </br>	D:A
"if that be the case, said the ass, ""we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the best in the world!"" </br>"	N:Su-
"when it was ready and the soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin and said: ""i have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me, and left me to hunger, and now i want to take my revenge."" </br>"	A:A
follow me, said the dead woman. </br>	N:N
believe me, i entertain for you the kindest wishes in my heart; but to feel for you what i now know can be felt for another man, can never be. </br>	N:N
well, that is a famous dish! said the princess. </br>	H:N
ribby in the meantime had received duchess's answer, and as soon as she was sure that the little dog would come--she popped her pie into the oven. </br>	N:N
"i can see and hear, it thought; ""the sun shines upon me, and the forest kisses me. </br>"	H:N
besides, they could not imagine exactly how it felt to be boiled and placed on a silver dish; but no doubt it was something very fine and highly genteel. </br>	N:N
all the flowers came round her directly, and asked if she had hurt herself, especially those who had lain in her bed. </br>	Su-:N
he now stood up to his neck in water, while deeper and deeper sank the boat, and the paper became soft and loose with the wet, till at last the water closed over the soldier's head. </br>	N:N
whenever the bottom of the trunk cracked, he was in a great fright, for if the trunk fell to pieces he would have made a tremendous somerset over the trees. </br>	F:F
then the huntsman promised to procure as much game for him as he could possibly use at the royal table. </br>	N:N
"dullard! exclaimed the brothers, ""what are you going to do with that?"" </br>"	D:Su-
she looked up, and by her side stood a man wrapped in a black cloak, with a hood closely drawn over his face; but her keen glance could distinguish the face under the hood. </br>	N:N
she at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. </br>	H:H
yes, and one day an old pot was so alarmed, that he fell down and was broken to pieces. </br>	N:N
so all this, and everything else that i have seen, keeps running in my head, and these must be the old recollections that bring so many thoughts with them. </br>	N:N
but next morning they all came back again to owl island; and twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of old brown's doorway, and said-- </br>	N:N
every day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts. </br>	N:N
the robbers were hanged. </br>	H:N
he happened to meet a nurse with a little child. </br>	N:N
i don't want to fly, said one of the young storks, creeping back into the nest. </br>	A:N
he had been there the day before to say farewell, and his mother was now very busy packing up various things for him to take with him on his voyage. </br>	N:N
it spoke of the glory of its birth; it told of the strength of the sunlight, which had caused its delicate leaves to expand, and given to it such sweet perfume. </br>	N:N
"then said the little spring from which ran the water, ""girl, why art thou breaking thy water-jug?"" </br>"	N:N
"if thou wilt own that thou openedst the forbidden door, i will give thee back thy two little sons."" </br>"	N:N
pigling had never said shuh! to a hen in his life, being peaceable; also he remembered the hamper. </br>	N:N

"travelling would be all very well, said the student of divinity to himself, ""if we had no bodies, or if the body could rest while the soul if flying. </br>"	N:N
ib's house was well and prettily furnished; for he was a prosperous man now, while the mother of the little girl rested in the churchyard at copenhagen, where she had died in poverty. </br>	H:N
the next heart was also a sanctuary, which he felt almost unworthy to enter; it represented a mean garret, in which lay a sick mother; but the warm sunshine streamed through the window, lovely roses bloomed in a little flowerbox on the roof, two blue birds sang of childlike joys, and the sick mother prayed for a blessing on her daughter. </br>	N:N
on the wall near the centre of the room hung the picture of a beautiful lady, young and gay, dressed in the fashion of the olden times, with powdered hair, and a full, stiff skirt. </br>	N:N

ah! how often then it thought of those better days- of the times when in the fresh, green wood, it had poured forth rich wine; or, while rocked by the swelling waves, it had carried in its bosom a secret, a letter, a last parting sigh. </br>	N:N
thinking as he did of old times, no wonder the three nuts came into his mind which the gypsy woman had given him when a child, and of the two which he had given to christina. </br>	N:N

he went on and came to the town wherein stood the unfruitful tree, and there too the watchman wanted an answer. </br>	N:N
"the woman said: ""but i have nothing but bread and cheese."" </br>"	A:N
but at length they asked what it was that made them so proud, and what kind of a thing a jewel might be. </br>	N:N
then go where thou wilt. </br>	N:N
oh, no one. </br>	F:N
then she opened the door of the small house, and when she had opened it, there stood twelve horses, such horses, so bright and shining, that his heart rejoiced at the sight of them. </br>	H:H
out in the river lay the ships, icebound, and forsaken by their crews; a screaming crow represented the only living creature on board. </br>	N:N
he had given up his certain appointment, and travelled for six months in foreign lands, and, on his return, had lived in great style, and got into terrible debt. </br>	N:N
it is not. </br>	N:N
"it is a very odd thing that ribby's pie was not in the oven when i put mine in!

he waited till it was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then seeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it. </br>	Su+:N
the children, who saw from a distance that some one was approaching, thought that their dear father was coming to them, and full of joy, ran to meet him. </br>	H:H

"no one ever places it in a nosegay; it is often trodden under foot, there are so many of them; and when they run to seed, they have flowers like wool, which fly away in little pieces over the roads, and cling to the dresses of the people.

he went back to his work. </br>	N:N

one glory eclipsed another; yet there was one picture that fixed itself on the little boy's memory, more especially because of the happy children it represented, for these the little boy had seen in daylight. </br>	H:H
she had made a vow to take no one as her lord and husband who did not promise to let himself be buried alive with her if she died first. </br>	N:N
years passed away, and at last the linen was so worn it could scarcely hold together. </br>	N:N

he had carried his master through fire and smoke in the battle-field, with the bullets whistling round him; he had kicked and bitten, and taken part in the fight, when the enemy advanced; and, with his master on his back, he had dashed over the fallen foe, and saved the golden crown and the emperor's life, which was of more value than the brightest gold. </br>	N:N
"what can this be?

morning dawned, and as the sun rose, the whole city and the king's castle sank suddenly down together. </br>	N:N
still she said not a word of all this; she could not relieve her heart by telling the laborer's wife, lest the latter should think she did not enjoy her former position at the castle. </br>	N:N

his thoughts were on, as he supposed, a very distant time- of making his will, and of his burial, and of when it might all come to pass. </br>	N:N
"early in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was stirring in the inn, chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the egg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the fireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep, and seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord""s easy chair and the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept away as softly as possible. </br>"	N:N
hans, however, went with them, and when it was night they came to a cave in which they lay down to sleep. </br>	N:N

he had a bite on his ear, and both the puppies were limping. </br>	N:N
the well was deep, and therefore the rope had to be a long one; it was heavy work turning the handle when any one had to raise a bucketful of water over the edge of the well. </br>	N:N
oh, for my horse's skin, i sold it yesterday. </br>	N:N
as soon as they had passed, little benjamin bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of mr. mcgregor's garden. </br>	N:N
so the fisherman went. </br>	N:N
they had been unable to decide whether they would keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would separate. </br>	N:A

then came two servants in grand livery, and carried the fir-tree into a large and beautiful apartment. </br>	N:N
the air was heavy and dark; there were no blossoms on the heath; the autumn winds whirled the yellow leaves towards the boatman's hut, in which strangers dwelt; but the little farm stood safely sheltered beneath the tall trees and the high ridge. </br>	N:N

"when she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to rake the ashes, the cook said, ""let that alone till the morning, and heat the king""s soup; i should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care you don""t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of never eating again."" </br>"	N:A
she was obedient, went thither and cut a hole in the ice; and while she was in the midst of her cutting, a splendid carriage came driving up, in which sat the king. </br>	N:N
the woman went down, and found all three in the midst of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then elsie told her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. </br>	Sa:N

the sweetest fresh butter and the finest bread were put into the basket by the furrier's daughter herself, for she packed it. </br>	N:N
this is very peculiar, said the tailor of gloucester, and he lifted up the tea-cup which was upside down. </br>	Su-:N
in that solemn hour the sweet and joyous chiming filled the hearts of those in the humble dwelling with thankfulness and trust; and when, amidst these joyous sounds, a little son was born to them, the words of prayer and praise arose from their overflowing hearts, and their happiness seemed to ring out over town and country in the liquid tones of the church bells' chime. </br>	H:H

there you will see an old fountain out of which a large tree has grown, whereon hangs a bird in a cage which you must take down. </br>	N:N
"meantime the huntsman came nearer and looked at the lady, and said to himself, ""i have been travelling so long that i should like to go into this castle and rest myself, for i have money enough to pay for anything i want""; but the real reason was, that he wanted to see more of the beautiful lady. </br>"	Su+:N
"thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough, said the other; ""thou art only meeting thy reward"": so he played up another tune. </br>"	A:A
the chairs were broken, and the window, and the clock fell with a crash, and there were handfuls of mr. tod's sandy whiskers. </br>	N:N
this they would not tell him, so the king asked the eldest if she really would take him for her husband? </br>	N:N

to be a stranger in a strange land is a bitter lot; no one notices you unless you happen to stand in their way. </br>	N:N
to be sure, storks cannot be expected to know how old children and grown-up people are. </br>	N:N

yes indeed, they can, replied the student. </br>	N:N
then he pried into every corner, and searched, but could not find anything. </br>	N:N

mr. tod descended safely from the chair, and endeavored to get up again with the pail of water. </br>	N:N

thousands of people gazed at the balloon, and the old maid who was in the garden saw it also; for she stood at the open window of the garret, by which hung the cage containing the linnet, who then had no water-glass, but was obliged to be contented with an old cup. </br>	N:N
three persons declared that they had gone as far as the end of the wood; they had always heard the strange sound, but there it seemed to them as if it came from the town. </br>	N:N
once upon a time there was a little girl called lucie, who lived at a farm called little-town. </br>	N:N
the truth was, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress, blackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was catskin again. </br>	N:N
she said that it was a shocking thing to do, that it was very improper, and that karen was always to go to church in future in black shoes, even if they were old. </br>	Su-:N

all around the bed and peeping through the long velvet curtains, were a number of strange heads, some very ugly, and others lovely and gentle-looking. </br>	N:N

the wolf wanted to follow him, but he had made himself so fat with eating that he could no longer get through, but stuck fast. </br>	N:N
hans had not thought of looking to that. </br>	N:Su-

"he took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on the ground, and said: ""if you are strong enough, help me to carry the tree out of the forest."" </br>"	N:N

dark days and cold nights also passed over the old bell, and it noticed them not; but the bell in the man's heart felt it to be a gloomy time. </br>	Sa:Sa
they first drove to the little house which he had built with the silver tools, and behold it was a great castle, and everything inside it was of silver and gold; and then she married him, and he was rich, so rich that he had enough for all the rest of his life. </br>	H:N
when the animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each into his hole, and the birds had won the battle. </br>	Su-:H

so he made up his mind to remember one of them in his will, as the one to be buried with him in the family vault, whenever that event should happen. </br>	N:N
and then what happened? </br>	N:N
peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes. </br>	N:N
i know everything, answered he. </br>	N:N
they could not hear me, and to go to them was quite out of my power. </br>	Sa:N

so he went back to the wood, seated himself in his trunk, flew up to the roof of the castle, and crept through the window into the princess's room. </br>	N:N
and what can the next daughter do? asked the old goblin. </br>	N:N
do you recollect that? they asked one after another, thus bringing to his remembrance circumstances that made the perspiration stand on his brow. </br>	N:F
"the canary-bird fluttered in his cage, and the parrot flapped his wings and cried, ""let us be men;"" the poor clerk, in the most deadly terror, flew through the window, over the houses, and through the streets, till at length he was obliged to seek a resting-place. </br>"	F:F
but the song was not done; there were many more verses in it, long verses, the most beautiful verses, the golden treasures of a life. </br>	N:N
apparently tommy brock had turned the same way. </br>	N:N
"when they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses, and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very much tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, ""now all is quite safe""; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine clothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. </br>"	N:N

hansel and gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near. </br>	N:Su+
as soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would say. </br>	N:N
"wait, said he, ""i will warm you a little,"" and went to the fire and warmed his hand and laid it on the dead man""s face, but he remained cold. </br>"	Su-:N

what a strange feeling it is- surely we all know it- to look through old letters of our young days; a different life rises up out of the past, as it were, with all its hopes and sorrows. </br>	Sa:N

his grandmother scolded him. </br>	A:A
benjamin and flopsy were in despair, they could not undo the string. </br>	F:Sa

the top said nothing, but he thought of his old love; and the more she said, the more clear it became to him that this was the same ball. </br>	N:N
some one is dying, thought the little girl, for her old grandmother, the only one who had ever loved her, and who was now dead, had told her that when a star falls, a soul was going up to god. </br>	Sa:N
when the king came home, he observed the empty cage, and asked the queen how that had happened. </br>	A:N
i am not very young, i have neither wife nor children, nor a library, but, as i said, i read the intelligencer, which is enough for me; it is to me a delightful paper, and so it was to my father. </br>	H:N
it was the dawn of morning before the wicked man reached home; he took off his hat, and went into his sister's room. </br>	N:N
the emperor immediately sprang out of bed, and called for his physician; but what could he do? </br>	Su-:N
i shall go distracted! scolded mrs. tittlemouse. </br>	A:A
the little mice came out again and listened to the tailor; they took notice of the pattern of that wonderful coat. </br>	N:N
then the uproar began again, there was a roaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. </br>	N:N

but from that time forward, the whole shop, from the cash box down to the pinewood logs, formed their opinions from that of the cask; and they all had such confidence in him, and treated him with so much respect, that when the huckster read the criticisms on theatricals and art of an evening, they fancied it must all come from the cask. </br>	N:N

"her waiting-maid said: ""i will find a cure for him; he shall soon learn what it is to shudder."" </br>"	A:N

the two sharp ones waited until hans had fallen asleep, then they got up, and went away leaving him where he was. </br>	N:N
when he came to the ferry-man he was expected to give the promised answer. </br>	N:N

then, when the bird came home and had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following morning: and that was really a very delightful life. </br>	N:N
the poor horses looked wretched; the flies settled on their backs in swarms, and they were only relieved when the coachmen got down and drove the creatures off. </br>	N:N

she was thinking, like the bottle, of the green wood, and of a young betrothed pair, who were closely connected with herself; she was thinking of that hour, the happiest of her life, in which she had taken part, when she had herself been one of that betrothed pair; such hours are never to be forgotten, let a maiden be as old as she may. </br>	H:N

"then the king put in a word, and said, ""each of you is right; and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great deal better. </br>"	Su-:Su+
"farewell, my sweet bride; for so you are to me."" </br>"	Sa:N
"so she said to the frog, ""well, if you will bring me my ball, i will do all you ask."" </br>"	N:H
"he listened, and heard an ant-king complain: ""why cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? </br>"	A:Sa
it was a pleasure to hear alfred describe anything. </br>	N:H
"yes, answered the cat, ""you will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the window."" </br>"	A:D
she informed her father how it had turned out. </br>	N:N
"why art thou sitting here in the wilderness?"" </br>"	N:N
"and as he thought it came to gnaw at it, he drew his sword and said, ""as long as i live, thou shalt not touch her,"" and hewed the snake in three pieces. </br>"	A:N
pigling bland who was a sedate little pig, looked solemnly at his mother, a tear trickled down his cheek. </br>	Sa:Sa
"at first ib said not a word, but he became as white as the wall, and shook his head gently, and then he spoke,- ""christina must not refuse this good fortune."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
"catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way, ""frederick wants something to eat; but i don""t think he is very fond of butter and cheese: i""ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar, for i have often seen him take some."" </br>"	N:H
"alas! dear sir, said she, ""yonder lies the granite rock where all the costly diamonds grow, and i want so much to go there, that whenever i think of it i cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only the birds and the flies--man cannot."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
this was a funeral oration over the old tree; short, but well-meant. </br>	N:N
so they gave it him, charging him to try it on a tree. </br>	N:N
he lay quite stunned and still. </br>	Su-:F
but we can give the ants a commission; they run here and there, as if they all had so much business to get through. </br>	N:N
"he was ready to die with thee and restored thee to life again, but thou hast murdered him in his sleep, and shalt receive the reward that thou deservest."" </br>"	D:N

"then said the wolf, ""i shall not leave until the barrel is empty."" </br>"	N:N
"how lonely it is, wife, said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, ""for you and me to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!"" </br>"	Sa:Sa
"but just as karen was lifting up her foot to get in too, the old soldier said: ""dear me, what pretty dancing shoes!"" and karen could not help it, she was obliged to dance a few steps; and when she had once begun, her legs continued to dance. </br>"	N:N
i became so tired, so heavy, that the beam broke, and i flew out into the gleaming au, where the water is deepest, and where the au-mann lives, solitary and alone; and year by year i tell him what i have heard and what i know. </br>	Sa:N
then the branch was broken off for her, and she held it in her delicate hand, and sheltered it with her silk parasol. </br>	N:N
"he is ill!
57:57	su-:n	-:-	that is madness- a joyless madness- besieged by fear and dreadful dreams! </br>"	Su-:N
"oh, replied the man, with a smile; ""and yet they are very witty, and are much read at court. </br>"	H:N
which way? which way has he gone, cousin peter? </br>	F:N
palms and branches were painted on the walls, and in the middle of the court stood a great blooming rose-tree spreading out its fresh boughs, covered with roses, over a grave. </br>	N:N
he was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall. </br>	N:N
he carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy. </br>	N:N
"he does not go forward with the times, and that i do not like."" </br>"	N:N
then she went home to bed, and the dog presently returned with the princess. </br>	N:N
"then there arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, ""if i had not found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use; therefore she ought to be mine."" </br>"	A:A
in its topmost branches the wood-pigeon built her nest, and the cuckoo carried out his usual vocal performances, and his well-known notes echoed amid the boughs; and in autumn, when the leaves looked like beaten copper plates, the birds of passage would come and rest upon the branches before taking their flight across the sea. </br>	N:N
mrs. tiggy-winkle was nothing but a hedgehog! * * * * * * </br>	Su-:N
"poor creature! said all the roses; ""only be still, and we will hide you. </br>"	Sa:N
"all- all are here."" </br>"	H:N
"they must be followed instantly to get them back again."" </br>"	F:F
there had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk. </br>	N:N
in the centre of the great hall, a golden perch had been fixed for the nightingale to sit on. </br>	N:N
the lions represent strength; and the hearts, gentleness and love. </br>	N:N
"tiny sailed past many towns, and the little birds in the bushes saw her, and sang, ""what a lovely little creature;"" so the leaf swam away with her farther and farther, till it brought her to other lands. </br>"	N:N
and now came the glowing iron. </br>	N:N
and then suddenly they all ran away together down the passage behind the wainscot, squeaking and calling to one another as they ran from house to house. </br>	N:N
day and night she had attended to the sick child, nursing and carrying it in her bosom, as a part of herself. </br>	N:N
the owner, mr. peter thomas piperson, came with a lantern and a hamper to catch six fowls to take to market in the morning. </br>	N:N
her eyes were glazing, and her heart breaking; but so it would have been, even had the sun not shone that morning on anna dorothea. </br>	Sa:N
so he took his meal on his back, went home, and told the bailiff that he had done what he had been told to do, and would now have the reward agreed on. </br>	N:N
only the ceiling was so low that lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there. </br>	N:N
the good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them from that time forward, as long as they lived. </br>	H:H
hitherto he had been a land crab; the land at last cast him adrift. </br>	N:N
it was linen which had been laid to bleach on the grass. </br>	N:N
the door was locked, and he could not reach the knocker. </br>	N:N
"are you deaf?
222:222	n:n	n:n	are you going to market? </br>"	N:N
delayed is not forgotten! </br>	H:N
i think it wants another five minutes, said ribby. </br>	N:N
we must try to find out if it is! </br>	H:N
"well, yes; people write poems when they are in love, but a wise man will not print them.

182:182	n:n	n:s	this is a triangle, or more properly speaking, the half of the broken die of fortune. </br>"	N:N
then he dropped in five more dirty, kicking, cackling hens upon the top of pigling bland. </br>	N:N
old mr. bouncer was in charge of the family that afternoon, because benjamin and flopsy had gone out. </br>	N:N
a week has passed; this morning his death was in the newspaper, that is the reason of the girl's mourning! </br>	Sa:Sa
tom kitten coughed and choked with the smoke; he could hear the sticks beginning to crackle and burn in the fireplace down below. </br>	N:N
the pressure of regularity and discipline here stamped the jewel, which in the future the world so well knew. </br>	N:N
he was well entertained, and in the evening was taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their twelve beds. </br>	N:H
meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve his late companion some trick. </br>	A:A
don't plague him so, interposed the portuguese duck; he requires rest and nursing. </br>	D:N
"countryman, said the witch, ""who are you? and what is your business?"" </br>"	A:N
then they stretched out their claws. </br>	N:N
"i know so much, at least, that the hare only ran from cowardice, and because he thought there was danger in delay.
15:15	n:n	n:s	i, on the other hand, made running the business of my life, and have become a cripple in the service.
16:16	n:n	n:a	if any one had a first prize, it ought to have been myself.

have i not reason to creak? </br>	N:N
"her own daughter, who was ugly as night, and had only one eye, grumbled at her and said, ""a queen! that ought to have been my luck."" </br>"	D:N
then hans goes to his mother. </br>	N:N
it was really most amusing. </br>	N:N
and then she spoke of the dark days of trial, when misfortune had fallen upon them. </br>	N:N
"now comes your turn, said he to the young tailor; ""sew the eggs and the young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall have done them no harm."" </br>"	N:N
just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of the princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all away secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. </br>	N:N
but he has nothing on at all, cried at last the whole people. </br>	D:Su-
when he had crossed the water he found the entrance to hell. </br>	N:N
"yes, this also was something."" </br>"	N:N
"the silken flag waved to and fro, on the shield itself a double eagle was displayed, and a big boot; the youngest lads carried the ""welcome,"" and the chest of the workmen's guild, and their shirt-sleeves were adorned with red and white ribbons; the elder ones carried drawn swords, each with a lemon stuck on its point. </br>"	N:N
yes; but you must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you. </br>	N:N
the huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand in his pocket and gave her what he had. </br>	Sa:N
then the child opened his eyes and looked into the glorious happy face of the angel, and at the same moment they found themselves in that heavenly home where all is happiness and joy. </br>	H:H
now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through which he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever. </br>	N:Su+
afterwards he was sent over to ask the little boy if he would not like to pay a visit himself. </br>	N:N
a footman dressed in silk and velvet stood with a large silver-mounted rod near the entrance. </br>	N:N
when she went in and said good-evening, a piece of gold at once fell from her mouth. </br>	N:N
the maiden found everything exactly as the old woman had said, and on her way back she found her two brothers who had sought each other over half the world. </br>	Su+:N
what is the old maid thinking of? </br>	Sa:N
"no, said the cat, ""you must first do something more for me of the same kind. </br>"	N:N
"now they must sing together, said the court, ""and what a duet it will be."" </br>"	H:N
when the king saw him he fell into a passion, and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. </br>	A:A
"why, frederick, said she, ""i did not know i was doing wrong; you should have told me before."" </br>"	Sa:Su-
in the little heartbook are many more of them. </br>	N:N
"yes, said the ass, ""if we could only get in""; so they consulted together how they should contrive to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. </br>"	H:N
it was a very small stuffy fusty room, with boards, and rafters, and cobwebs, and lath and plaster. </br>	N:N
"i can lie up there, said little claus, as he saw the roof; ""it will make a famous bed, but i hope the stork will not fly down and bite my legs;"" for on it stood a living stork, whose nest was in the roof. </br>"	N:N
and this reflection put the beetle into a good temper. </br>	H:H
"i have three tiresome beasts here, said the other; ""if you will take them, give them food and room, and treat them as i tell you, i will pay you whatever you ask."" </br>"	A:N
once upon a time there was a very beautiful doll's-house; it was red brick with white windows, and it had real muslin curtains and a front door and a chimney. </br>	N:N
i shall sleep now, he whispered to himself. </br>	N:N
"go home, then, said the fish; ""she is in the cottage already!"" </br>"	N:N
"and as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so cool and pleasant that the two brothers said, ""let us sit down by the side of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink."" </br>"	N:N
"oh, trouble not yourself about that, said the dwarf; ""only undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence, whatever meets you first on your going home, and i will give you as much as you please."" </br>"	N:N
fundevogel and lina loved each other so dearly that when they did not see each other they were sad. </br>	N:Sa
inside the house there was a great crash and splash, and the noise of a pail rolling over and over. </br>	N:N
"now when they found a little brook leaping brightly over the stones, the brother was going to drink out of it, but the sister heard how it said as it ran, ""who drinks of me will be a tiger; who drinks of me will be a tiger."" </br>"	N:N
let us be men now. </br>	N:N
but lo! the servant of one of the robbers secretly approached her; they must not see it, otherwise they would have killed him. </br>	Sa:N
the flowers now appeared in their most gorgeous robes, but all in vain; they had not the fresh, fragrant air of youth. </br>	N:N
but wherever did you get all these fine beasts? asked great claus. </br>	N:N
cross-patch tried to bite me. </br>	A:A
"never mind, he said, ""i have larger maps upstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,"" but they searched in vain, for the castle was not marked even on these. </br>"	D:Sa
we hear his song- we hear it now in the room while the white bees are swarming without, and the storm clutches the windows. </br>	N:N
"and then, asked the fir-tree, trembling through all its branches, ""and then what happens?"" </br>"	N:F
"who has been gnawing bones up here in the chimney?
98:98	f:f	f:f	i wish i had never come!
99:99	f:n	f:n	and what a funny smell?
100:100	n:f	f:f	it is something like mouse, only dreadfully strong.
101:101	n:n	f:f	it makes me sneeze, said tom kitten. </br>"	N:N
"well, said little claus, ""it was good policy on my part; you heard me say just now that i was told by the sea-maiden to go a mile farther on the road, and i should find a whole herd of cattle. </br>"	N:N
what was the dream, then? asked he, and was quite curious. </br>	A:N
she rubbed another match on the wall. </br>	N:N
"it certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right time!"" </br>"	Sa:Sa
the giant, however, carried him home, suckled him, and thumbling grew and became tall and strong after the manner of giants. </br>	N:N
shall i sing once more before the emperor? asked the nightingale, who thought he was present. </br>	N:N
"then the king""s son lost sight of her, and could not find out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said to him, ""the unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and i think she must have sprung into the pear-tree."" </br>"	N:N
don't go home, peter, cried the street boys. </br>	N:N
little benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables. </br>	N:N
how partlet died and was buried, and how chanticleer died of grief </br>	N:N
"they knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was hansel and gretel, she said: ""you naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were never coming back at all!"" </br>"	A:A
then the boy called to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose, he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. </br>	A:N
"i smell mans flesh,"" said he; ""all is not right here."" </br>"	A:N
"see, said the angel, pointing to the wonderful straw, ""this is what the poor woman has brought. </br>"	H:N
bend your head as we do, said the flowers. </br>	F:N
it could only think of the poor captive bird, for which it could do nothing. </br>	N:N
the words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned, dragging another young girl along with them. </br>	N:N
then karen put out her little foot too. </br>	N:N
. . . his coat was pulled off, and he was rolled up in a bundle, and tied with string in very hard knots. </br>	N:N
then he opened the window to get some fresh air, but before he was aware, the head-servant had given him such a kick that he flew through the window out into the air, and so far away that no one ever saw him again. </br>	N:N
at this the king was overwhelmed with joy, and made it known thoughout all his kingdom, that if his son would come back to his court he would forgive him. </br>	H:H
once when it flew screaming over his head mr. tod snapped at it, and barked. </br>	A:N
and as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven. </br>	Sa:N
mr. pipe-head, a father. </br>	N:N
nobody wished to let others know he saw nothing, for then he would have been unfit for his office or too stupid. </br>	N:N
peep! that is 'the beautiful.' </br>	Su+:N
but at last, just as it went merrily out again, the two boys were called, and so angrily, that they hastened to obey, and ran away as fast as they could from the pond, so that the little ship was left to its fate. </br>	N:N
the christmas lights rose higher and higher, till they looked to her like the stars in the sky. </br>	N:N
"we complied, and she wrote; but in the midst of the ""general war-"" she struck fast, sighed deeply, and said, ""i am only a woman!"" </br>"	Su-:Sa
"then she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at last her tears softened him, and he said, ""i will give you three days"" grace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your child."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
it was rather hurt. </br>	Su-:Sa
"meanwhile, the birds sang merrily outside, and the sun was shining so beautifully warm, it seemed as though every little flower said: ""god, thy kindness towards us all is without limits."" </br>"	H:N
but she only said this to frighten jack the dullard; and the clerks gave a great crow of delight, and each one spurted a blot out of his pen on to the floor. </br>	H:H
thank you, said the woman, and she gave the fairy twelve shillings, which was the price of the barleycorn. </br>	H:N
not a creature could be seen. </br>	N:N
yes, said little claus, and he tied up the sack, and then walked off with all the cows and oxen. </br>	N:N
they were just turning in at the gate to the barn of farmer potatoes. </br>	N:N
and then the others went to hear god's word, but she went alone into her little room; this was only large enough to hold the bed and a chair. </br>	N:N
after another long pause, pigling pushed a peppermint under the door. </br>	N:N
there you may lie, said the queen, and went her way. </br>	H:N
they will hang one, and roast another. </br>	N:N
"no, said he; ""there is only a little dirty ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; i am sure she cannot be the bride."" </br>"	D:D
the pea-blossom pleased him most of all; she was white and red, graceful and slender, and belonged to those domestic maidens who have a pretty appearance, and can yet be useful in the kitchen. </br>	H:H
and when lily came to the castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. </br>	H:H
then the little man took leave of him. </br>	N:N
then he asked if he had let anyone come in. </br>	N:N
and once when the king had ridden forth to hunt, she took the little shirts and went into the forest, and the ball showed her the way. </br>	N:N
then the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it as usual: </br>	N:N
it was the mother of the child who lay there on a miserable bed. </br>	N:N
they rushed at each other with such extreme rage that the ground shook with their trampling, and the air resounded with their cries. </br>	N:A
but i am the eldest! exclaimed the third. </br>	A:N
"but the tree would not rejoice, though it grew taller every day; and, winter and summer, its dark-green foliage might be seen in the forest, while passers by would say, ""what a beautiful tree!"" </br>"	N:N
on reaching the entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every step she took. </br>	N:N
the moonbeams twinkled on the carving knife and the pie dish, and made a path of brightness across the dirty floor. </br>	N:N
one of the frankish gentlemen made me stand in front of a rock, and drew us both as we stood there, so that we looked like one creature. </br>	N:N
what we call the veins on a leaf, he took for roads; ay, and very long roads they were for him; for before he had half finished his task, the sun went down: he had commenced his work too late. </br>	N:N
she went round the farm garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck. </br>	N:N
"that traveler came to our house too, and wanted to sleep here, and i sent him away."" </br>"	D:N
gretel presents hans with a piece of bacon. </br>	N:N
whither away, hans? </br>	N:N
it made one shiver with cold to look at him. </br>	N:N
"in the white lily bloom, bonny girl, is thy tomb."" </br>"	N:N
this was my destiny; it is quite a blessing. </br>	H:H
what was it she saw lying there? </br>	N:N
but these mirrors magnified in an astonishing degree; in the middle of the floor sat, like the grand lama, the insignificant i of the owner, astonished at the contemplation of his own features. </br>	N:N
and this part is really the most pleasant part of the story. </br>	N:N
ib held up another nut. </br>	N:N
the daughter also was close by; so they carried the weakly queen into the bath-room, and put her into the bath; then they shut the door and ran away. </br>	N:N
it was christina of the heath! </br>	Su+:N
he paused, gazed at the strange vehicle, and questioned the women as to the goal of their journey and the place whence they came. </br>	N:N
"ill put a screw into that business,"" said the little tailor. </br>"	A:A
under a glass beneath the picture hung a nosegay of withered flowers, which were no doubt half a century old too, at least they appeared so. </br>	N:N
the customers came in crowds every day and bought quantities, especially the toffee customers. </br>	N:N
the wind, the wind, the heaven-born wind, </br>	F:N
"the wolf said, ""dear fox, tell me why thou art running here and there so much, and jumping in and out?"" </br>"	N:N
he came for the sake of the daughter. </br>	N:N
they had, in fact, come head-over-heels down the well, in the person of the old mother-toad, who was still alive. </br>	N:N
first i was a poet, and now i am a lark. </br>	N:N
but he had his number, and his own peg; for everything here was ordered like clockwork, which we all know is of the greatest utility- people get on so much better together when their position and duties are understood. </br>	N:N
but where was the nightingale to be found? </br>	N:N
it is dreadfully hot here! observed the first brother. </br>	Su-:N
"but her mother squeezed it in till the blood came, and took her to the king""s son: and he set her as his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her. </br>"	N:D
this is serious, cousin tabitha, said ribby. </br>	F:N
so he took a great stone which was lying there, and placed it in the basket, and when it was about half way up, his false brothers above cut the rope, so that the basket with the stone fell to the ground, and they thought that he was dead, and ran away with the three princesses, making them promise to tell their father that it was they who had delivered them, and then they went to the king, and each demanded a princess in marriage. </br>	N:N
first he ate some lettuces and some french beans; and then he ate some radishes; </br>	N:N
"indeed they were continually making three foot-scrapings with the left foot and also said ""peep!"" </br>"	N:N
he thought of all those who had once suffered from starvation, of saint elizabeth, who once wandered on the earth, the saint of his home and his childhood, the noble duchess of thuringia, that highly esteemed lady who visited the poorest villages, bringing hope and relief to the sick inmates. </br>	N:N
and then the tree told the little mice all about its youth. </br>	N:N
"oh! she said, ""i have knocked off brother""s head,"" and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her. </br>"	Sa:Sa
you must bear it, said the little boy. </br>	N:N
pigling bland was shocked, there was little hope of sleeping in market town, and tomorrow was the hiring fair; it was deplorable to think how much time had been wasted by the frivolity of alexander. </br>	Su-:Su-
the boy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for some time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it, sold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the twelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. </br>	N:N
on this picture the boy's eyes rested longer than on any other: the metal pig stood still before it. </br>	N:N
to thy death art thou sped, until gods word be said. </br>	D:N
"on seeing the sparrow which the boys had brought, and which they said they did not want, he asked, ""shall we make it look very pretty?"" </br>"	N:N
"when daylight comes, and she sees what she has done, we shall be lost."" </br>"	F:N
when the old folks were asleep, hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and hansel could not get out. </br>	Sa:Su-
what did gretel give you? </br>	N:N
what dost thou think of that? </br>	N:N
next day, the second stayed at home, and he fared no better. </br>	N:N
this evil thought took possession of her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. </br>	A:A
but he was already dead. </br>	N:N
ribby and tabitha set to work to search the house thoroughly again. </br>	N:N
he met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and his country in the same manner. </br>	H:N
so they went to him at once, and threw him down, and his soul broke into fragments, and went into the gambling vagabonds who are living this very day. </br>	N:N
"but the giant thought, ""we must do better than that,"" took him back again, and suckled him two years longer. </br>"	N:N
who is there? asked somebody from within. </br>	N:N
presently it seemed as if something fell from the table. </br>	N:N
i will put them into my pillow, and then i am sure i shall sleep soundly without rocking. </br>	N:H
"we did not see any more, said the sparrows; ""but this was enough for us."" </br>"	N:N
once the bell hung in the church tower; but now there is no trace left of the tower or of the church, which was called st. alban's. </br>	N:N

god's will is the best, he would then say. </br>	H:N

drum-ma-rum! drum-ma-rum! there he is! the drum might have said, and his mother might have sung, if she had seen or dreamt it. </br>	N:N

the metallic groups of figures, among which were perseus and the rape of the sabines, looked like living persons, and cries of terror sounded from them all across the noble square. </br>	N:F
the fire had only just been lighted, and it was not hot; but there was a white choky smoke from the green sticks. </br>	N:N
after the branches were lopped off, the trunks looked so slender and bare, that they could scarcely be recognized. </br>	N:N
"poor rose-bush! said the child, ""let us take it with us to heaven, that it may bloom above in god's garden."" </br>"	Sa:Sa

the table on which the tin soldiers stood, was covered with other playthings, but the most attractive to the eye was a pretty little paper castle. </br>	N:N
mr. tod standing on the unsteady chair looked down upon him attentively; he really was a first prize sound sleeper! </br>	N:N
you have eaten them yourself. replied ginger. </br>	N:N
"do you see, said the sunbeam, ""do you see the beauty of these flowers? do you see their powers of giving pleasure?"" </br>"	H:N
he looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the whole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece. </br>	H:Su+
then the little figures on the tree will become lively, and the little waxen angel at the top spread out his wings of gold-leaf, and fly down from his green perch. </br>	N:N
i shall not tell you, replied the garter. </br>	N:N
he led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the foxgloves. </br>	N:N
there the child fared well, ate sugar-cakes, and drank sweet milk, and her clothes were of gold, and the little angels played with her. </br>	H:N
"i presume you are a girdle, said the shirt-collar, ""a sort of under girdle. </br>"	N:N
then he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs asleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat the pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. </br>	N:N
she saw the new altar with the painted pictures and the carved angels. </br>	N:N
so chanticleer began to build a little carriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, partlet jumped into it and sat down, and bid chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her home. </br>	N:N
yes, it is infested with rats, said tabitha tearfully. </br>	Sa:Sa

the proposal pleased the bailiff, he called the head-servant that very evening, and ordered him to take eight bushels of corn to the mill, and grind it that night, for it was wanted. </br>	N:N
in the garden close by grew many large and magnificent flowers, and, strange to say, the less fragrance they had the haughtier and prouder they were. </br>	N:N
"when she went home the mouse inquired: ""and what was the child christened?"" </br>"	N:N
then he asked what that could be, but the old woman said that she had got that from the violent perspiration, and would soon lose it again. </br>	N:N
"so she went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of her top drawer; then she set the boy""s head again on his shoulders, and bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed him on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand. </br>"	N:N
she had just the same manners while playing, bending her long yellow face from side to side, and nodding in time to the beautiful music. </br>	N:N
a land-owner followed, who in the month for sowing seed attended to the ploughing and was fond of field sports. </br>	N:H
"i should be very silly, said he, ""if i went to that shabby house, and left this charming place""; so he went into the smart house, and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too. </br>"	H:H

his staff had fallen out of his hand, and his eyes stared at the moon, about which his honest soul was wandering. </br>	N:N
the other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but nutkin gathered robin's pin-cushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle-pins. </br>	N:N
the same thing had happened to anastasia. </br>	N:N

a wonderful blaze of light streamed from one of the monuments in the left-side aisle, and a thousand moving stars seemed to form a glory round it; even the coat-of-arms on the tomb-stone shone, and a red ladder on a blue field gleamed like fire. </br>	N:N
"yes, said the mother, ""if only someone would come who would have her."" </br>"	N:N
why, what have you found this time? inquired the brothers. </br>	N:N

"the elder brother smiled when he heard that, and thought to himself: ""goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is! </br>"	D:H
he was dirty and ugly, half-frozen and half-starved; he always looked as if he never had enough to eat, which was really the case. </br>	N:N
"but what can we do with him? said the shepherd, ""he has not a tooth in his head, and the thieves don""t care for him at all; to be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood; tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it."" </br>"	D:A
he had been born old, and did not at all resemble the birds flying in the air- the sparrows, and the swallows; no, he despised them, these mean little piping birds, these common whistlers. </br>	A:A
oh! how she shivered with the cold. </br>	Sa:N
but it was not true; the speaker only wanted to remind him of his name, and to make an april fool of him; for with that fun the fourth generally began his career. </br>	Su+:N
she was taken to copenhagen under the protection of her future mother-in-law, because the bridegroom could not spare time from his numerous occupations for a journey so far into jutland. </br>	N:N
they crept out of their tunnel, and hung about amongst the rocks and bushes, listening anxiously. </br>	F:F

in the middle of the floor lay a dead swallow, his beautiful wings pulled close to his sides, his feet and his head drawn up under his feathers; the poor bird had evidently died of the cold. </br>	Sa:N
he had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. </br>	N:N
"when they arrived at mr korbes""s house, he was not at home; so the mice drew the carriage into the coach-house, chanticleer and partlet flew upon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into the washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the millstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself up in the towel. </br>"	N:N
but what a kribbling and krabbling was there! </br>	F:N
his son inherited his wealth, and he lived a merry life with it; he went to a masquerade every night, made kites out of five pound notes, and threw pieces of gold into the sea instead of stones, making ducks and drakes of them. </br>	H:N

some men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes right-- all that falls to them is so much gain--all their geese are swans--all their cards are trumps--toss them which way you will, they will always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so much the faster. </br>	N:N
but in his reply, he said, if he had to take a part, he must enjoy the sport from his own home; they were to arrange for him to do so; and so they did. </br>	N:N
so he went away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering about a few days he luckily found it. </br>	H:N

then she saw a large purple crocus jump into the middle of the table where the playthings stood, go up to the doll's bedstead and draw back the curtains; there lay the sick flowers, but they got up directly, and nodded to the others as a sign that they wished to dance with them. </br>	H:N
out of the thicket stepped a tall old woman, her face quite brown, and her hair of a deep shining black; the whites of her eyes glittered like a moor's; on her back she carried a bundle, and in her hand a knotted stick. </br>	Su-:N
quunk!- ah! </br>	Su-:N
are we spending the evening properly? </br>	N:N
she had eight of a family: four little girl pigs, called cross-patch, suck-suck, yock-yock and spot; and four little boy pigs, called alexander, pigling bland, chin-chin and stumpy. </br>	N:N
then they began to fancy they could soar, so they tried to do so, resting on their wings, but they soon found themselves falling, and had to flap their wings as quickly as possible. </br>	N:N
why did not somebody tell me? </br>	A:N
they sat down, read their hymn-book, and held each other by the hand, while the sun shone down upon the fresh roses and upon them. </br>	H:N
"whilst he was standing thus undecided, a voice sounded out of the rock, which cried to him, ""enter without fear, no evil shall befall you thee."" </br>"	N:F
at last the flowers wished each other good-night. </br>	N:N
"the emperor ordered them to be carried into the great hall where the princess was just playing ""visitors are coming"" with her ladies-in-waiting; when she saw the large cases with the presents therein, she clapped her hands for joy. </br>"	H:H
but she thought a great deal about ribby's pie, and she read ribby's letter over and over again. </br>	N:N
then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks shook. </br>	F:F
in comfortable rooms they encounter hospitality and friendly faces. </br>	N:N
"then she untied her golden garter and put it round the roebuck""s neck, and she plucked rushes and wove them into a soft cord. </br>"	N:N
"ah, said he quite roughly and surlily, ""you may just go, then; i shall be back again before any of you."" </br>"	A:N
sure enough the roly-poly noise was still going on quite distinctly under the attic floor. </br>	N:N
now the old lady fell ill, and it was said that she would not rise from her bed again. </br>	N:N
and he was obliged to go accordingly. </br>	N:N
"brother, think of this; i have seen her daily, she has grown up beside me, and has become a part of my soul."" </br>"	N:N
then he gave her some wine and bread, and when she had regained her strength, he raised her up and they went to the door and knocked, and called so loudly that the sentries heard it, and told the king. </br>	N:N
the boy never forgot what his mother told him, and the tones of the old bell reverberated in his heart till he reached manhood. </br>	N:N
what art is that? asked the fox. </br>	A:N
"no, indeed, it is not true, replied the old servant, raising her eyes to heaven; ""she was worth a great deal; i knew it years ago, and since the last night of her life i am more certain of it than ever. </br>"	N:N
some witch told you that!-- some witch told you that! cried the little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the floor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it out. </br>	A:A
"however, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ""i will help you; lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be dead."" </br>"	N:H
even if thou couldst return, and at least produce so much, very likely, when made, the brick would be useless, unless done with a good will, which is always something. </br>	N:N
the principal person in the procession was a clerical-looking gentleman. </br>	N:N
she stepped inside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned throughout. </br>	N:N
very little was said about the matter to ib, and he did not refer to it; his mother, however, noticed that he had grown very silent and pensive. </br>	Sa:Sa
there, now, the truth is out. </br>	N:N
they cast lots, and the lot fell on the eldest; so next day the two younger went out to seek, and the eldest had to stay home. </br>	N:N
he would have liked this very much during his life, as well as the poems about him in the papers, for he liked nothing so well as to be talked of. </br>	N:N
when she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. </br>	A:A
mercy! cried karen. </br>	F:F
no, madam! </br>	N:N
my drake is a native of these parts; he's not of my race; but i am not proud on that account. </br>	N:N
"we are not prepared, said they, ""to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke."" </br>"	F:N
but he had a strange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared, and no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more dish. </br>	N:N
but it was agreed, that, if he could bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the bird and the horse given him for his own. </br>	N:N
she was buried; two large tears rolled over the cheeks of the earnest man, and in the parsonage it was empty and still, for its sun had set for ever. </br>	Sa:N
"the manikin said: ""that is an easy thing for me to do, but a very dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill."" </br>"	F:F
"yellow buttons! said they: ""let us have a look at them."" </br>"	Su+:H
"only one, replied the fir-tree; ""i heard it on the happiest evening of my life; but i did not know i was so happy at the time."" </br>"	N:N
is that to-day's number of the day? he asked, quite mechanically, as he saw the woman putting by a large piece of paper. </br>	N:Su-
"as soon as she had done this, the frog said, ""put your plate nearer to me, that i may eat out of it."" </br>"	N:N
pigling bland and alexander trotted along steadily for a mile; at least pigling bland did. </br>	N:N
grand, dark, and gloomy appeared the landscape around him. </br>	Su+:N
the old wartburg castle stood unchanged on the rock where the monk and the nun were hewn out of the stone. </br>	N:N
"'you are talking too much,' said the tinder-box, and the steel struck against the flint till some sparks flew out, crying, 'we want a merry evening, don't we?'

"no power on earth must equal mine, far less exceed it."" </br>"	H:N
so he went along the street with her; and as they passed under a lamp, the light fell on the little girl's face. </br>	N:N
"with her five gold rings at the door she knocks: ""are you within, good mistress fox? </br>"	N:N
as they passed from hall to hall, beauty everywhere showed itself; and as the metal pig went step by step from one picture to the other, the little boy could see it all plainly. </br>	H:N
"ah! he sighed mournfully, as he gazed at the birds singing merrily, or hopping from branch to branch, ""they are much better off than i. flying is a glorious power. </br>"	Sa:Sa
in the avenue he met two school-boys, who appeared to belong to a better class of society, but whose inferior abilities kept them in the lowest class at school. </br>	N:N
then twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely-- </br>	N:N
oh dear, how i am creaking. </br>	D:N
"but at last the girl said, ""be quiet, dear little roe, i will never, never leave you."" </br>"	N:N
tommy brock and all the young rabbit babies had disappeared! </br>	N:N
"wheres that?"" said the wolf. </br>"	Su-:Su-
no; i did not see any of the eruptions which are represented in those pictures; but i will show you a sketch of my own, which represents an eruption i once saw. </br>	N:N
"this touched the old king""s heart, and he thought his son might still be guiltless, and said to his court, ""o that my son were still alive! how it grieves me that i had him killed!"" </br>"	D:Sa
when mr. tod got to the tree, he found that the weight and strain had dragged the knot so tight that it was past untying. </br>	N:N
for the next twenty minutes mr. tod kept creeping cautiously into the house, and retreating hurriedly out again. </br>	N:N
then those mice set to work to do all the mischief they could--especially tom thumb! </br>	N:A
"i wonder what will be the end of it."" </br>"	N:N
his conscience was clear and his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed, left all his cares to heaven, and soon fell asleep. </br>	H:H
another day chanticleer and partlet agreed to go again to the mountains to eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found should be shared equally between them. </br>	N:N
blow thy brazen trumpet, thou trumpeter clad in fox-skin! it sounds merrily in the clear air. </br>	N:N
if you have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. </br>	F:F
i need not describe it, but only say that there stood in it an earthen pot with handles, made for holding fire, which in italy is called a marito. </br>	N:N
and so they really were. </br>	N:N
the violent band surrounded the church; i heard tell of it. </br>	N:N
his little sister gustava, with her blue eyes, and fair curly hair, had grown up a beautiful maiden all at once, and without having wings she could fly. </br>	N:N
the rich merchants in bremen and lubeck, who carried on trade in copenhagen, did not reside in the town themselves, but sent their clerks, who dwelt in the wooden booths in the hauschen street, and sold beer and spices. </br>	N:N
she went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. </br>	N:N
"look! said care; ""what happiness have your goloshes brought to mankind?"" </br>"	D:N
he was ugly, and his hair was matted, and he looked crippled and stunted; they called him the field-laborer's boy, though in the church register he was entered as anne lisbeth's son. </br>	N:N
it was black and sooty within, and the devil was not at home, but his grandmother was sitting in a large arm-chair. </br>	N:N
"perhaps after all, i am still in a well, only in a larger well.

many thanks, replied the old woman. </br>	H:N
the old elf king had his gold crown polished up with powdered slate-pencil; it was like that used by the first form, and very difficult for an elf king to obtain. </br>	N:N
"let's see what they have given us for dinner, pigling?"" </br>"	N:N
can one not persuade them to live in peace and quietness, so that each one may mind his own business? </br>	Su-:N

"the swans swept towards her and sank down so that she could throw the shirts over them, and as they were touched by them, their swan""s skins fell off, and her brothers stood in their own bodily form before her, and were vigorous and handsome. </br>"	N:N
you have played me another trick, said he. </br>	A:N
from all the roofs and gables and old wooden houses in gloucester came a thousand merry voices singing the old christmas rhymes--all the old songs that ever i heard of, and some that i don't know, like whittington's bells. </br>	N:N
"the shepherd said: ""if nothing more than that is needful in order to be mayor, i would get into the barrel at once."" </br>"	Su+:N
"the poor man""s wife shook hands with him, and welcomed him, and said he was to make himself at home and put up with what they had got; they had not much to offer him, but what they had they would give him with all their hearts. </br>"	H:N
then he squeezed into the larder. </br>	N:N
then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. </br>	N:N
peter scuttered underneath the bushes. </br>	F:N
keen weather to-day! say the people, as they step in. </br>	N:N
"then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their hunger, and cried: ""we will remember you--one good turn deserves another!"" </br>"	H:H
"ah, answered he, ""let mercy take the place of justice, i only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. </br>"	F:F
then the frog put his head down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the spring. </br>	N:N
they filled the bottle with seeds, though it scarcely knew what had been placed in it. </br>	N:N
a great king of a land far away in the east had a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she only made sport of them. </br>	D:N

there they found their child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their troubles they lived happily together to the end of their days. </br>	H:H
"so they said, ""well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and, little as he is, we will love him dearly."" </br>"	H:H
then he cut a caper, and became so bold that he even tapped at the window; but the bundle never moved. </br>	N:N
and she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tail-coat with no tail belonging to squirrel nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to peter rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty! </br>	N:N
the servants carried out his orders, but one single gnat had placed itself inside one of the coverings, crept into the prince's ear and stung him. </br>	N:N
"i am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a white ring round its neck, i cannot refuse."" </br>"	N:N
"do we meet here?

all went off well, answered the cat. </br>	H:H
in the same manner he befriended two other countries through which they passed on their way. </br>	N:N
it would be very sad, were i to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter; but when it had passed, he found himself lying one morning in a moor, amongst the rushes. </br>	N:Sa
but when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home and have it bound up. </br>	F:N
"i have never done that yet."" </br>"	N:N
the leaf is kept, but the friendship does no longer exist. </br>	Sa:N
but the old grandfather remained sitting at his work and carving away at the last part of it, which was the danish arms. </br>	N:N
"you certainly know how to speak for yourself very well, said the ball; ""but i cannot accept your proposal. </br>"	N:N
and the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower, to fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. </br>	N:N
sally henny-penny, have you found three pocket-handkins? </br>	Sa:N
the door stood open; the poor creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes, and lie down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow. </br>	N:Sa
this, however, none of them could ever do; for the thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there they stuck fast, and died wretchedly. </br>	N:Sa
they had also music with them. </br>	N:N
"do you know one?"" </br>"	N:N
let me prop you up with a pillow, my dear duchess; where do you think you feel it? </br>	N:N
your majesty must admire the colours and the pattern. </br>	N:N
then he ordered that the place should be surrounded with a golden railing, and a sentry stationed near it. </br>	N:N
the snowflakes fell on her long, fair hair, which hung in curls on her shoulders, but she regarded them not. </br>	N:N
"then the twelfth of the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its mischief; so her gift was, that the king""s daughter, when the spindle wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a hundred years. </br>"	N:Sa
simpkin came away from the shop and went home considering in his mind. </br>	N:N
"when night came she wanted to go home; and the king""s son would go with her, and said to himself, ""i will not lose her this time""; but, however, she again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped her left golden slipper upon the stairs. </br>"	F:N

the flax was in full bloom; it had pretty little blue flowers as delicate as the wings of a moth, or even more so. </br>	N:N
as none of the flowers seemed to notice sophy, she let herself down from the drawer to the floor, so as to make a very great noise. </br>	N:N
"when two years had passed, the old giant took him into the forest, wanted to try him, and said, ""pull up a stick for thyself."" </br>"	N:N
all that the boy had heard of old preben and his wife seemed clearly defined on the stone, and as he gazed on it, and glanced at the clear, bright moon shining in the pure air, it was as if the light of god's countenance beamed over his beautiful world. </br>	H:N
he flew first into the butter-cask, then into the meal-tub, and out again. </br>	N:N
then his opposite neighbor stepped over to the house in which old anthony lived, for he had not yet showed himself. </br>	N:N
this said, he flew out at the door, and poor lily followed; and every now and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to journey. </br>	Sa:Sa
a little while later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping. </br>	Sa:Sa

when the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it as before; but to her great grief it still said: </br>	A:Sa

"you shall at once go into your coffin again,"" and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut the lid. </br>"	A:N
the miller rejoiced, and said that the mill was now released from the spell, and wanted to give him much money as a reward. </br>	H:H
he intends to risk his life alone in the roaring waters; but they are to bear witness for him that it is not his fault if jens glob stands without reinforcement in the church at widberg. </br>	N:N
perhaps he also was looking for nuts; he seemed to be sniffing around. </br>	N:N
and at length they fell into rags and tatters, and thought it was all over with them, for they were torn to shreds, and steeped in water, and made into a pulp, and dried, and they knew not what besides, till all at once they found themselves beautiful white paper. </br>	N:N
the squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening. </br>	N:N
"goodbye, mother."" </br>"	N:N
each leaf was fresh, and each flower was like a beautiful female head; some with dark and sparkling eyes, and others with eyes that were wonderfully blue and clear. </br>	N:N
the clerks pondered for a long time, but at last they said that no one was sure of his life with the head-servant, for he could kill a man as easily as a midge, and that the bailiff ought to make him get into the well and clean it, and when he was down below, they would roll up one of the mill-stones which was lying there, and throw it on his head; and then he would never return to daylight. </br>	N:N
good heavens, how it crushes! said the darning-needle. </br>	Su-:Su-

and then the fowl turned away. </br>	N:N
he now wanted to drive on, but his horeses could not work their way through, so he unharnessed them, laid them on the top of the cart, took the shafts in his own hands, and pulled it all through, and he did this just as easily as if it had been laden with feathers. </br>	N:N
"said the wolf, ""i will go when thou dost, that thou mayest help me if i am not able to get away."" </br>"	N:N
to be born in a duck's nest, in a farmyard, is of no consequence to a bird, if it is hatched from a swan's egg. </br>	N:N
"then she seated herself on a stone, ordered the young man to come to her, and after she had imprinted a friendly kiss on his lips, she said, ""my long-desired deliverer, kind heaven has guided thee to me, and put an end to my sorrows. </br>"	H:N
down to my child, she repeated; and tones of despair and entreaty sounded in the words. </br>	Sa:Sa
they were very large, so large, indeed, that they had belonged to her mother, and the poor little creature had lost them in running across the street to avoid two carriages that were rolling along at a terrible rate. </br>	N:N
on his return, he went to visit one of the little towns in the island of zealand. </br>	N:N
then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife. </br>	Sa:Sa
"oh, i didn't put one in, my dear duchess, said ribby; ""i don't think that it is necessary in pies made of mouse."" </br>"	N:N
then they were all terrified, and the king took the bird, the fisherman and the three children back with him to the castle, and ordered the prison to be opened and brought his wife out again. </br>	F:F
he fixed the leaf to the student's cap in the green wood, when they vowed eternal friendship. </br>	H:N
"then it is not i,"" and went to another door; but when the people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she could get in nowhere. </br>"	F:N
and the people gave a cheer for the speech, but they shouted much louder for the harlequin, when he appeared in front of the platform, and made a grimace at them. </br>	N:N
he still lay thinking and thinking, when all at once it seemed as if some one kissed him on his eyes and mouth. </br>	Su+:N
it outlived the storms and the calm, it struck against no rocks, was not devoured by sharks, but drifted on for more than a year, sometimes towards the north, sometimes towards the south, just as the current carried it. </br>	N:N
why, i see a table spread with all kinds of good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry. </br>	Su-:Su+
but marguerite did not answer him; she was offended that he should call her a woman when she was only a girl; and there is a great difference. </br>	A:A
do you think it is poisoned? </br>	A:N
and she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear mrs. tiggy-winkle. </br>	H:H
presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he could nowhere see the cook. </br>	Sa:N
"and when the king came back, they told him that the queen had once more given birth to a dog, and he again said, ""what god does, is well done."" </br>"	N:N
"when she had eaten her bread, they gave her a broom and said, ""sweep away the snow at the back door with it."" </br>"	N:N
lights were shining from every window, and there was a savory smell of roast goose, for it was new-year's eve- yes, she remembered that. </br>	N:N

tommy brock snored industriously, with rather a snort. </br>	N:N
and all came to pass as she had said; heinel bore all, and spoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his neck and kissed him. </br>	H:H
they knew each other: the boy was the one who had not been able to go with them because he had to take the coat and boots back to his landlord's son. </br>	N:N
the same day he was allowed to leave, but the goloshes remained at the hospital. </br>	N:N
then they all lay down to have a nap. </br>	N:N
there was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. </br>	N:N
he had two triangular pieces of tile in his head, instead of eyes; his mouth was made of an old broken rake, and was, of course, furnished with teeth. </br>	N:N
"lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say ""good-night,"" and to thank the washer-woman.--but what a very odd thing! </br>"	N:Su-

my only pleasure is to be made clean and shining after dinner, and to sit in my place and have a little sensible conversation with my neighbors. </br>	N:N

when old mr. bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door. </br>	N:N
an old friend had just come to visit her, and they talked, not about the bottle neck, but of the myrtle in the window. </br>	N:N
close before the bottle passed a single pair, like the bridal pair- the mate and the furrier's daughter- who had so long ago wandered in the wood. </br>	N:N
"then she opened the door for her husband, and said: ""thank heaven, you are back again! </br>"	F:F
they were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. </br>	N:N
then there came into the room a child- the queen's little son. </br>	N:N
in the old heathen days, in the times of the vikings, the popular speech was enshrined in the harp of the bard. </br>	N:N
she laid hold of his ears. </br>	N:N
the youngest- the critic- outlived them all, which was quite right for him. </br>	N:N
then he waded sideways through inches of soot. </br>	N:N
"alexander gobbled up his dinner in no time; he had already eaten all his own peppermints--""give me one of yours, please, pigling?"" </br>"	N:N
and the boiling water out of the kettle fell upon the tail of mr. tod. </br>	N:N
"she thought god could not take her darling little one from her; and when it did happen notwithstanding her hopes and her belief, and there could be no more doubt on the subject, she said in her feverish agony, ""god does not know it. </br>"	Sa:Sa
"however, i""ll try and set up a trade in pots and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them."" </br>"	A:N
this needle is quite useless for sewing now, said the fingers; but they still held it fast, and the cook dropped some sealing-wax on the needle, and fastened her handkerchief with it in front. </br>	N:N
"the old man held his tongue, but heinel said again, ""what do you want here?"" </br>"	N:N
all the rags were made into white paper, and the shirt collar became the very identical piece of paper which we now see, and on which this story is printed. </br>	N:N
"then an angel from heaven came to her and said: ""be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing, so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have."" </br>"	N:H
"it is most extraordinary good fortune."" </br>"	H:N
"there it goes, she said; ""the more i pluck, the more beautiful do i get."" </br>"	H:N
and the cow? </br>	N:N
she looked with earthly eyes, and could not see as the child saw,- he whom god has called to be with himself. </br>	N:N
and mr. alderman ptolemy tortoise brought a salad with him in a string bag. </br>	N:N
"in walks the little dog--says ""pussy are you there? </br>"	N:N
"she ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then she knocked at the window and cried: ""hans, is elsie within?"" </br>"	F:N
when they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. </br>	A:N
"you will reach a village in the evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you to be very poor and mean."" </br>"	N:N
if the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together. </br>	Sa:Sa
but mr. jeremy liked getting his feet wet; nobody ever scolded him, and he never caught a cold! </br>	H:N
"i didn't know any better then, and the flowers all died."" </br>"	N:N
as heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and the people around told him that his queen was about to marry another husband. </br>	N:N
what do you think of that crowing? said the yard cock to the hens and chickens. </br>	A:N
have you not shuddered then? </br>	Su+:N
"i say i will be emperor."" </br>"	N:N
one morning his corpse was found in the canal. </br>	N:N
"look how your brother works, but you do not even earn your salt."" </br>"	A:N
"the youth, however, was without fear, and said: ""just let me go down to the barking dogs, and give me something that i can throw to them; they will do nothing to harm me."" </br>"	N:N
and then she told a story that made the feathers on the other hens bristle up, and the cock's comb fall. </br>	N:N
"he looked at everything full of admiration, and was on the point of going out again, when he once more heard the voice which said to him, ""step on the stone which lies in the middle of the hall, and great good fortune awaits thee."" </br>"	H:H
"you must choose for yourself one of those lovely flowers, and i will put you down upon it, and then you shall have everything that you can wish to make you happy."" </br>"	H:N
"then she said: ""well, gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace, why should god""s good gifts be spoilt?"" </br>"	H:H
as soon, as the summer was over, the wedding should take place. </br>	N:N
he had jumped into the dust-bin, where all sorts of rubbish were lying: cabbage-stalks, dust, and rain-droppings that had fallen down from the gutter under the roof. </br>	N:N
the master of the ceremonies announced that the bearers of the canopy, which was to be carried in the procession, were ready. </br>	N:N
but the hint was not taken, and consequently the ship was not bought. </br>	N:N
presently, he came to a pond where mr. mcgregor filled his water-cans. </br>	N:N
"you shall have no horse from me.
25:25	d:n	d:n	you don't know how to speak- you can't arrange your words.

"at length as he could come to no decision, he pulled off his boot, and said, ""take this boot, it has a hole in the sole of it. </br>"	N:N
mamma-in-law acknowledged that sophy was not only a clever housewife, but well-informed and accomplished, though that could hardly be expected in a person of her limited means. </br>	N:H
and the old tree, as it still grew upwards and onwards, felt that his roots were loosening themselves from the earth. </br>	N:N
then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and turned them till they were round. </br>	N:N
i thank you kindly, little dog, i fare as well as you! [old rhyme] </br>	N:H
one of the ladies had to go and ask; but she put on pattens. </br>	N:N
"oh, for heavens sake!"" cried the miser, ""master! master! pray let the fiddle alone. </br>"	F:Su-
in the morning two persons came up to the ditch. </br>	N:N
when at last they awoke, it was already dark night. </br>	N:N
she sang successfully through three or four verses, only at every verse her head nodded a little lower, and her little twinkly eyes closed up-- </br>	N:N
then the sunbeam spoke of the boundless love of god, as seen in creation, and over all that lives, and of the equal distribution of his gifts, both in time and in eternity. </br>	N:N
"then said the boy: ""what a clever elsie we have!"" and sat down by her, and likewise began to howl loudly. </br>"	Sa:Sa
oh, how unfortunate, said the landlord, wringing his hands. </br>	Su-:N

"i was rowed across a river, answered he, ""and got it there; it lies on the shore instead of sand."" </br>"	N:N
now this hill was so big that the whole world could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had done very little, the fox came and said. </br>	N:Sa
anne lisbeth was a beautiful young woman, with a red and white complexion, glittering white teeth, and clear soft eyes; and her footstep was light in the dance, but her mind was lighter still. </br>	N:N
at last they came to a small cottage. </br>	N:N
the bees could not be driven away. </br>	N:N
it is around us, it is in us, it talks of our thoughts and of our deeds, and it speaks longer of them than does the bell down in the depths of the odense-au where the au-mann dwells. </br>	H:N
so far all had passed off very well; but now one of the citizens began to speak of a terrible pestilence which had been raging a few years before, meaning the plague of 1484. </br>	N:N
took her nothing, she gave me something. </br>	N:N
all the written letters became quite red in a moment, and all the words and thoughts turned to fire. </br>	N:N
the wood-pigeons cooed as if to explain the feelings of the tree, and the cuckoo called out to tell him how many summer days he had yet to live. </br>	N:N
'yes; well in my youth, i lived in a quiet family, where the furniture was polished, the floors scoured, and clean curtains put up every fortnight,' 'what an interesting way you have of relating a story,' said the carpet-broom; 'it is easy to perceive that you have been a great deal in women's society, there is something so pure runs through what you say.' </br>	Su+:N
ib and her father accompanied her to the village. </br>	N:N
once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. </br>	H:H
"i would have plucked them already if they had not been so big."" </br>"	D:N
how pleasant it was out in the forest while the snow lay on the ground, when the hare would run by, yes, and jump over me too, although i did not like it then. </br>	N:N
they were given him for a birthday present, and he stood at the table to set them up. </br>	N:N
it was, in fact, an old grave-stone. </br>	N:N
"you must learn to weave baskets."" </br>"	A:N
"why, i can get between the iron window-bars of the parsons house, and throw you out whatever you want."" </br>"	H:H
at first the trade went well; for many people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid their money without thinking of taking away the goods. </br>	H:N
"i cannot even crack a nut!"" and then he said to the tailor, ""here, crack me the nuts."" </br>"	D:N
when he had gone a hundred steps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him, and looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills and feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if each wished to have it himself. </br>	A:N
"thank you, said great claus; ""but remember, if i do not get any sea-cattle down there i shall come up again and give you a good thrashing."" </br>"	H:N

"the farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year""s service a penny. </br>"	N:N
one, two, three years went by, and during the whole time he received only two letters. </br>	Sa:N
so she lay there for an hour, yes, for two hours. </br>	N:N
then she took them into the room where a number of toys lay on a pretty little table, and the whole of the table drawer besides was full of beautiful things. </br>	N:N
and then she can tell the most wonderful stories. </br>	H:N
but pray make yourself at home; it is easy to make one's self comfortable. </br>	N:N
"that was ill done, hans.

then the woman fell down again as if dead. </br>	F:F
the giant made the attempt but he could not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand. </br>	N:N
little benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that mr. mcgregor had gone out in a gig, and mrs. mcgregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet. </br>	N:N
i have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then i am not a rabbit. </br>	N:N
"at last it popped into catherine""s head that it was the door itself that was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, ""frederick, i must throw the door down soon."" </br>"	N:Sa
however, he found an opening through which he passed, and came out upon where he expected to find the new market. </br>	N:N

"why, this is horrible; how dreadfully dirty it is! said the counsellor; and the whole pavement has vanished, and the lamps are all out."" </br>"	Su-:A

so it happened that by the time john joiner had got the plank up-- there was nobody here under the floor except the rolling pin and tom kitten in a very dirty dumpling! </br>	N:N
"will you tell us a story? said the queen,- ""one that is instructive and full of deep learning."" </br>"	N:N
he was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led to the outer chamber. </br>	N:H
but it had to travel, till at length it reached land- a foreign country. </br>	N:N
"home! home! look at the shoe!
99:99	n:n	h:h	princess! the shoe was made for you!

"the young man felt the truth of the proverb, ""still waters run deep:"" and his heart had sunk into their depths. </br>"	H:H
it is christmas. </br>	N:N
"ah, indeed, there was no one who thought or supposed, not even the old church bell which had been the first to sound and chime for him, that he would be the first to sing the beautiful song of ""the bell."" </br>"	N:N
what a pleasure that must be! </br>	H:N
then he laid himself down on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if he was fast asleep. </br>	N:N
but there was nobody there. </br>	N:N
"the wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother""s bed, and devoured her. </br>"	N:N
i have done all this only to cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your ill-treatment of me. </br>	H:N
but we are very much frightened, said the young storks, and they drew back their heads into the nests. </br>	F:F
the next morning the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to die, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as swiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird given him for his own. </br>	F:Su+
that night he lay awake, thinking of the metal pig; indeed, it was always in his thoughts. </br>	N:N
what a mercy that was not a pike! said mr. jeremy fisher. </br>	H:H
"in the white lily bloom, brave boy, is thy tomb."" </br>"	N:N
the maids often laid the clean copper saucepans and kitchen vessels on this stone, that they might dry in the sun, and the children were fond of playing on it. </br>	H:N
mr. tod was mystified; he sat quite still, and listened attentively. </br>	Su-:F
she shut the door violently, and ran away. </br>	N:N
on this day, just one hundred years had passed since the day on which the chiming of the old church bell at marbach had filled the mother's heart with trust and joy- the day on which her child was born in poverty, and in a humble home; the same who, in after-years, became rich, became the noble woman-hearted poet, a blessing to the world- the glorious, the sublime, the immortal bard, john christoper frederick schiller! </br>	N:N
then she told the king the evil deed which the wicked witch and her daughter had been guilty of towards her. </br>	N:N
the english pirates had taken some ships in the channel in 1801, and the counsellor, supposing they referred to these, agreed with them in finding fault with the english. </br>	N:N
a fire had been kindled in the midst of the hut, and while the hot ashes lay there red and glowing, the bread was baked in them. </br>	N:N
no one had bought anything of her the whole day, nor had any one given here even a penny. </br>	Sa:N
the huntsmen, however, did not let themselves be turned aside by that, but climbed the tree and fetched the maiden down and led her before the king. </br>	N:N
and round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and the straw was all spun into gold. </br>	N:H
the rabbit babies in the oven woke up trembling; perhaps it was fortunate they were shut up inside. </br>	F:F
"as he began to put himself into the sack heels first, ""wait a while,"" said the gardener, ""that is not the way."" </br>"	N:N
"she inquired further, ""and yet slew twelve, what is that?"" </br>"	N:N
the lamp in the bed-chamber had been partly shaded, and the windows were covered with heavy curtains of some costly silken material. </br>	N:N
the gracious lady seemed like a flower that was rather stiff in the stalk. </br>	N:N
after a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move. </br>	N:N
and it was just she who had the jewel. </br>	N:N
thereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board and screwed their feet fast. </br>	A:N
the birds of passage had also paid the weather-cock a visit and told him of foreign countries, of airy caravans and robber stories that made one's hair stand on end. </br>	N:N
"it certainly has not yet withered; but in the course of years the number of blossoms from time to time will grow less, and at last it was cease altogether to bear fruit; and then its history will be over."" </br>"	Sa:N
pickles ate biscuits and ginger ate a dried haddock. </br>	N:N
"i know even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable to save me."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
the collar had become so old that he began to think about getting married; and one day he happened to find himself in the same washing-tub as a garter. </br>	N:N
then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden slipper. </br>	H:H
they generally stuck a table-knife and spoon in their girdles, as well as a larger knife, as a protection to themselves; and such a weapon was often very necessary. </br>	N:N
"yes, father, it shall be as you will.
56:56	n:n	s:n	if you desire nothing more than that, i can easily keep it in mind. </br>"	Sa:N
the merchant thought this was no great thing to ask; that it would most likely be his dog or his cat, or something of that sort, but forgot his little boy heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and signed and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him. </br>	N:N
and who were these strangers? </br>	N:N
at the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than before. </br>	H:H
flames of fire shot forth, after which followed a great smoke, which hid the stag from his sight. </br>	Su-:N

"your seeing her would have been of no use, said the thief, ""if i had not taken her away from the dragon; therefore she ought to be mine."" </br>"	A:A
"red-cap, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf""s belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead. </br>"	Su-:F
"those fellows up there did not open their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which they had on their bodies get burnt."" </br>"	A:N
daa and his daughters could not help hearing it, so i blew about their ears to drown the noise; what use was it that they should listen? </br>	D:N
it was just confirmation-day. </br>	N:N
he had been brought into existence amidst the joyous shouts of boys, the jingling of sleigh-bells, and the slashing of whips. </br>	N:H
"song doth not carry them forth over the lands, nor into the hearts of men; therefore i have no rest and no peace."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
"now--odd as you may think it--it came to pass that this good woman""s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she had wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. </br>"	N:Su+
then old mr. bouncer smoked another pipe, and gave tommy brock a cabbage leaf cigar which was so very strong that it made tommy brock grin more than ever; and the smoke filled the burrow. </br>	H:N
as soon as he had fallen asleep, however, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and wished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. </br>	N:N
at last the boy said to him. </br>	N:N
i am so fine that even my mother cannot find me. </br>	Sa:N
there are rooms and halls in it, but we do not enter them, we remain in the kitchen, where it is warm and light, clean and tidy; the copper utensils are shining, the table as if polished with beeswax; the sink looks like a freshly scoured meatboard. </br>	N:N
a wooer he stands at the door out there. </br>	N:N
mr. jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out of reach, and went on eating his sandwich. </br>	N:N
and now he was off again with his crooked devils, and they went to hohenfuert and pulled up a hop-pole, and with it went to heaven and began to thrust the pole against it, and heaven began to crack. </br>	Su-:N
on such another easter morning as that on which waldemar daa imagined he had discovered the art of making gold, i heard the tones of a psalm under the stork's nest, and within the crumbling walls. </br>	N:N
thou shalt not be turned away. </br>	N:N
"then say you will give me, said the little man, ""the first little child that you may have when you are queen."" </br>"	Su-:N
they were the tears which old anthony had shed half a century before. </br>	N:N
shivering with cold and hunger, she crept along; poor little child, she looked the picture of misery. </br>	Sa:Sa
pig-wig! keep under the wall, there's a man ploughing. </br>	A:N
he opened the oven door, felt inside, and found something warm and wriggling. </br>	N:N
no sooner were the words spoken than he was at home. </br>	N:N

they at length agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be distinguished by some divine and miraculous token. </br>	N:N
he next tried to get off his horse and make his way on foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself unable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound. </br>	Su-:F
he comes sliding down the bellpull. </br>	N:N
"i know that, said the caterpillar, on the leaf, ""my leaf is the largest here. </br>"	N:N

from the tailor's ship in westgate came a glow of light; and when simpkin crept up to peep in at the window it was full of candles. </br>	N:N
"what a paltry place! said she; ""to whom does that little dirty hole belong?"" </br>"	Su-:A
then they went into a little room. </br>	N:N
talk of a pig, indeed! </br>	H:H
and as the last word was spoken, the saddle disappeared from his back, and he saw that his second wish had been fulfilled. </br>	Su-:N
the hat was on the head now, which made it very dark, and the little elf shuddered with fright and indignation at the wicked deed. </br>	F:F
then old mrs. rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the wood to the baker's. </br>	N:N
she thought that it looked a safe quiet spot. </br>	N:N
the family has sharp ears, and they all heard every word that their neighbour had said. </br>	N:N

54:54	n:n	h:h	in our house there was no lack of company; neighbors and friends visited us often, and we showed the greatest hospitality to every one.
55:55	n:n	n:n	so it came to pass one evening that a stranger came riding to our castle, and, under pretext of not being able to get on to the next place, begged for shelter for the night.
56:56	n:n	n:n	we granted his request with ready courtesy, and he entertained us in the most agreeable manner during supper by conversation intermingled with stories.

60:60	su-:su-	-:-	as i could not conceive from whence it came, i wanted to summon my waiting-maid who slept in the next room, but to my astonishment i found that speech was taken away from me by an unknown force.
61:61	n:n	-:s	i felt as if a mountain were weighing down my breast, and was unable to make the very slightest sound.
62:62	n:n	n:-	in the meantime, by the light of my night-lamp, i saw the stranger enter my room through two doors which were fast bolted.
63:63	n:n	n:-	he came to me and said, that by magic arts which were at his command, he had caused the lovely music to sound in order to awaken me, and that he now forced his way through all fastenings with the intention of offering me his hand and heart.
64:64	d:d	d:d	my repugnance to his magic arts was, however, so great, that i vouchsafed him no answer.
65:65	n:n	n:a	he remained for a time standing without moving, apparently with the idea of waiting for a favorable decision, but as i continued to keep silence, he angrily declared he would revenge himself and find means to punish my pride, and left the room.
66:66	n:f	n:f	i passed the night in the greatest disquietude, and only fell asleep towards morning.
67:67	n:n	n:f	when i awoke, i hurried to my brother, but did not find him in his room, and the attendants told me that he had ridden forth with the stranger to the chase by daybreak.
68:68	f:n	f:f	i at once suspected nothing good. </br>"	N:N
a little? </br>	N:N
"if the newspapers, or even the whole world, said of a certain subject, ""it is so-and-so;"" and a little schoolboy declared he had learned quite differently, they would take his assertion as the only true one, because he belonged to the family. </br>"	N:N

while it was alive and sang they forgot it, and let it suffer want in the cage; now, they cried over it and covered it with flowers. </br>	N:Sa

the whole town knew who the stranger was; and one of the richest men in the place gave a party in his honor, and all who were of any consequence, or who possessed some property, were invited. </br>	N:N
why this is beautiful, too beautiful to be believed, said the oak in a joyful tone. </br>	H:H

the hostess received the travellers with bare feet, untidy hair, and a dirty blouse. </br>	N:N

now, this is what had been happening to tom kitten, and it shows how very unwise it is to go up a chimney in a very old house, where a person does not know his way, and where there are enormous rats. </br>	N:N

"a ""peep"" and three foot-scrapings- in this way she had often greeted throughout the year, and no one here had responded, for those who are once parted do not meet every day; and so this greeting had become a habit with her. </br>"	Su-:N
i suppose it is only on our account that you perform this common-place work yourself, instead of leaving it to your servant to do all that sticking together. </br>	N:N
when the princesses saw him they fainted. </br>	Su+:Su+
the black bow signifies mourning, the girl's face points to the same in a still higher degree; it is preserved in the heart and will never be forgotten. </br>	Sa:Sa
but they dragged him out of the room and up stairs to the garret, and threw him on the floor, in a dark corner, where no daylight shone, and there they left him. </br>	N:N
"i was sewn together by a young lady, and i have a spanish cork in my body; but no one would think it, to look at me now.
41:41	n:n	n:s	i was once engaged to a swallow; but i fell in here from the gutter under the roof, and i have lain here more than five years, and have been thoroughly drenched.
42:42	n:n	n:s	believe me, it is a long time for a young maiden. </br>"	N:N
the next day when the children were playing together, and saw the storks, they sang the song again- </br>	N:N

"and when mr. john dormouse was complained to, he stayed in bed, and would say nothing but ""very snug;"" which is not the way to carry on a retail business. </br>"	N:N

"let hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow i will kill him, and cook him."" </br>"	H:N
"then they went out all day long to their work, seeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but snowdrop was left at home; and they warned her, and said, ""the queen will soon find out where you are, so take care and let no one in."" </br>"	F:N
"youre right,"" said hans, as he weighed it in his hand; ""but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle."" </br>"	N:N
and that is the life drama that passes before the old maid while she looks out upon the rampart, the green, sunny rampart, where the children, with their red cheeks and bare shoeless feet, are rejoicing merrily, like the other free little birds. </br>	Sa:N
"i dreamt that in a certain kingdom there stood an apple-tree which had once borne golden apples, but now would not even bear leaves.

"at this point old mrs. rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling: ""cotton-tail! </br>"	N:N
when the boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and whetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero fled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at once, and in one bound out again. </br>	A:N

this is exactly what we think, they all replied, and then the music-master received permission to exhibit the bird to the people on the following sunday, and the emperor commanded that they should be present to hear it sing. </br>	N:N

"mr. mcgregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after peter, waving a rake and calling out, ""stop thief."" </br>"	A:N
the parson went to the crowd, and declared that the mass had been said. </br>	N:N
every morning when the sun rose, and every evening when it went down, she would creep out at the door, and as the wind blew aside the ears of corn, so that she could see the blue sky, she thought how beautiful and bright it seemed out there, and wished so much to see her dear swallow again. </br>	Sa:N
"aha! she cried mockingly, ""you would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. </br>"	A:A
they pushed the front door--it was not fast. </br>	N:N
"hullo! cried he, ""another half belongs to this. </br>"	H:N
poisonous flies and gnats flew into the coach by thousands. </br>	N:N
they returned to the kitchen. </br>	N:N
they fitted her, and were bought. </br>	N:N

and they agreed to see whether they could not set the princess free. </br>	N:N
then the branch became proud, which was very much like human nature. </br>	N:N
the old remembrances awake, the faded colors glow with a fresh lustre, and story and song pour us a blessed draught which lifts up our minds and our thoughts, so that the evening becomes as a christmas festival. </br>	N:N
a whole row of windows stood open, so that the rude wind could enter at its pleasure, and the long white curtains waved to and fro in the current of air. </br>	N:N
and then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could be. </br>	H:H
and so we often pass each other in the world when we meet, as did these two, even while together in the same town. </br>	N:N
an old house stood there; it was in the large town with its busy traffic. </br>	N:N
i have never seen it in print. </br>	N:Su-
he will have a hundred kisses from the princess, said the lady, who had gone down to ask him. </br>	N:N
but this was scarcely an agreeable entertainment; for thoughts of olden memories raise the curtains from the past, and sometimes pierce the heart with painful recollections till the agony brings tears to the waking eyes. </br>	Sa:Sa
they watched him go into his house. </br>	N:N
they lifted her up, and combed her hair, and washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little girl seemed quite dead. </br>	Sa:N
"he looked down, and there was bellissima, little smooth-shaven bellissima, barking as if she would have said, ""here i am too; why are you sitting there?"" </br>"	Su-:N
mrs. meta was now on the chain, she could not even bark. </br>	F:N
so they took stock of the hole where the nest lay, and trotted away. </br>	N:N
"yes, said the king, ""they are twelve huntsmen."" </br>"	N:N
in his flight he had forgotten the most valuable things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in his pocket. </br>	F:N
he folded his arms and prayed, and soon sunk himself into healthful sleep; therefore he did not notice that his wife arose, threw on her clothes, and glided silently from the house, to go where her thoughts constantly lingered- to the grave of her child. </br>	N:N
the rushing of the water through the sluices, and the scream of the wild ducks, were almost the only signs of active life at silkborg. </br>	N:N
"so he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the spit, the queen""s ring was found inside her. </br>"	N:N
the king suspected no evil, and did not come back again till next morning; and as he talked with his wife and she answered him, with every word a toad leaped out, whereas formerly a piece of gold had fallen out. </br>	N:N
"well, said the father, ""we will try for once."" </br>"	N:N
they grew near the shelter of the walls, wound themselves round columns and window-frames, crept along passages and over the ceilings of the halls. </br>	N:N
stop! stop! and the words came quite clear, though they were like the croak of a frog, or the wail of a bird. </br>	A:N
not for gold or silver, but for flesh and blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom in his chamber, and i will give thee the whole brood. </br>	N:N
"bravo! said the ass; ""upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what is all this about?"" </br>"	H:Su-
stop! carry me to consecrated earth, sounded in her ears, in strange, hollow tones. </br>	N:N
"oh, thou knave, said the lord, ""were i to judge as thou judgest, how dost thou think thou couldst have escaped so long? </br>"	D:A
"it is more than nice, said the emperor, ""it is charming."" </br>"	H:N
shake, shake, hazel-tree, gold and silver over me! </br>	N:N
it was not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of the water, seized it, and drew it under. </br>	F:N
you could squeeze in, through that little round hole, said goody tiptoes. </br>	N:N
i hope i shall not be ill. </br>	N:N
"molly, however, did, though she only said the words, ""lady halle, lady halle,"" loudly and distinctly; the rest she muttered so much under her breath that anthony felt certain she had really said nothing; and yet she looked quite bold and saucy, just as she did sometimes when she was in the garden with a number of other little girls; they would all stand round him together, and want to kiss him, because he did not like to be kissed, and pushed them away. </br>"	N:N
"he told it me himself, and he hadn't ""a rogue on his back,"" as mother used to tell me he had when he wanted to make me believe something outrageous, for now he looked quite trustworthy. </br>"	N:N
only the tin soldier and the dancer remained in their places. </br>	N:N
"then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the table, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, ""cut all the eggs in two pieces at one shot."" </br>"	N:N
then they started. </br>	N:N
where did you get the seed? or is it only your good luck? </br>	Su+:Su+
peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. </br>	F:F
never would she be able to cling to the mercy of heaven till she had recovered this other half which was now held fast in the deep water. </br>	N:N
one of the slippers she could not find, and a boy seized upon the other and ran away with it, saying that he could use it as a cradle, when he had children of his own. </br>	N:N
"oh, said the father, ""she has plenty of good sense""; and the mother said: ""oh, she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing."" </br>"	N:N
i wonder what that crowd near the pigsty means! said the emperor, who had just come out on his balcony. </br>	N:N
then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the eggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take them back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing it. </br>	N:N
such evenings are long and dreary, unless people can find something to do; and so anthony found it. </br>	N:N
at last the thieves found him out, and lifted him up in their hands. </br>	N:Su+
and snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince; and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their wedding. </br>	H:N
the salt waves sprinkled their white foam over it, but it stood firm, and remained long after he who had given the bricks to build it was dead and buried. </br>	N:N
near the green lawn the father's walking-stick was tied to a post. </br>	N:N
he seated himself by her side on a large green leaf, gave her some honey from the flowers to eat, and told her she was very pretty, though not in the least like a cockchafer. </br>	N:N
tiny could, also, sing so softly and sweetly that nothing like her singing had ever before been heard. </br>	N:N
"yes, certainly it is, said jack the dullard; ""and clay of the finest sort. </br>"	H:N
then they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the king, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having had none at all for years. </br>	N:H
then he placed the old woman on the back seat, so that she might not fall out as he drove, and rode away through the wood. </br>	N:N
they go out rat-catching in the village, and they find plenty of employment. </br>	N:N
"i did not remember that i had minced it up so fine; i suppose this is a quicker oven than my own."" </br>"	N:N
and when the king came home they told him that the queen had been delivered of a cat. </br>	N:N
"it does not make me shudder,"" thought he. </br>"	N:N
then indeed there was a great panic. </br>	N:N
"so he told him what he had heard from the devil: ""kill the mouse which is gnawing at its root, and it will again bear golden apples."" </br>"	N:N
so the lord had the horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and asked crabb if he were doctor knowall. </br>	A:N
my friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; i am affronted, said mrs. tabitha twitchit. </br>	A:A
the storm reads out the accusation and the sentence, roaming in the air over moor and heath, and over the rolling waters. </br>	N:N
they dreamt that their mother flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed. </br>	H:N
she gave her too the shape and the look of the queen, only she could not make good the lost eye. </br>	N:N
but the frogs either did not or would not understand him. </br>	N:N
"ah! said the fisherman, ""she wants to be emperor."" </br>"	N:N
the next day came the little boy to whom the playthings belonged, and he painted the top red and yellow, and drove a brass-headed nail into the middle, so that while the top was spinning round it looked splendid. </br>	N:N
which is the despised plant you so specially pity? </br>	D:N
"it must go in, if i have to push it myself."" </br>"	N:N
"'i did not know that it was you- you had come as quickly as your letter; and you looked so handsome, and so you do still.
46:46	n:n	h:h	you had a large yellow silk handkerchief in your pocket and a shining hat on.
47:47	h:n	h:h	you looked so well, and the weather in the street was horrible!'
48:48	h:n	h:h	'then we married,' he said. </br>"	H:N
it was november, who coughed violently as he got out. </br>	N:Sa
the more the top thought of this, the more he longed for the ball. </br>	N:Sa
after a while he perceived both giants. </br>	N:N
the little flower could very well see that they were ill at ease, and pitied them sincerely. </br>	Sa:Sa
"do you think she would like to swim, or to let the water close over her head?"" </br>"	N:N
one evening, just as the sun set amid radiant clouds, there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes. </br>	N:N
"but there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping briar rose (for so the king""s daughter was called): so that, from time to time, several kings"" sons came, and tried to break through the thicket into the palace. </br>"	N:N
then a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible. </br>	N:N
"don't cut off my head! said karen, ""for then i could not repent of my sin. </br>"	F:N
sorry! he exclaimed, and his voice was troubled with a grief as deep as my own. </br>	Sa:Sa
and how? </br>	N:N
"good gracious! he sighed, ""i must have a tendency to softening of the brain, and here it is so exceedingly hot that the blood is rushing to my head."" </br>"	Su-:Su-
she lighted another match, and then she found herself sitting under a beautiful christmas-tree. </br>	H:N
the air was dark with flying tiles; old wood-work crashed and fell; and a wheelbarrow ran up the streets all alone, only to get out of the way. </br>	N:N
"the linden-trees were in blossom; while the swallows flew here and there, crying, ""twit, twit, twit, my mate is coming,""- but it was not the fir-tree they meant. </br>"	N:N
and the butterfly became what is called an old bachelor. </br>	N:N
the mother, however, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own daughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made to do all the work of the house, and was quite the cinderella of the family. </br>	N:H
"hark, hark! there she is, said the girl, ""and there she sits,"" she added, pointing to a little gray bird who was perched on a bough. </br>"	H:N
"so again st. peter said, ""lord, this thing cannot go on, we must let him in, or he will throw us down from heaven."" </br>"	D:N
"well, thought the young man, ""it is no hard matter to keep that advice."" </br>"	N:H
please, sir, the chimney wants sweeping, said poor tom kitten. </br>	F:N
the recollection of her pious deeds was as light to the soul of poor anthony. </br>	N:H
"many had already made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth saw the king""s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he forgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor. </br>"	N:H
well, we shall hear in the story. </br>	N:N
so the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the well called out as she saw her: </br>	N:N
he sat lifeless on the steps. </br>	N:N
i know better what to do than that. </br>	N:N
the king and queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw five or six young ones lying there. </br>	N:N
"well, father, he replied, ""i am quite willing to learn something-- indeed, if it could but be managed, i should like to learn how to shudder. </br>"	H:N
"then the peasant once more pinched the raven""s head till he croaked loudly. </br>"	N:N
"the king replied: ""yes, i would like to see her."" </br>"	H:N
his head ached, his back was stiff, and the blood had ceased to circulate, so that his feet were swelled and pinched by his boots. </br>	N:N
she wanted to sit down on the pauper's grave where the bitter fern grows; but for her there was neither peace nor rest. </br>	N:N
once in summer when he was working alone in the garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air might cool him. </br>	N:N
"when the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his pocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to himself: ""if i could but shudder! </br>"	Sa:N
then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him. </br>	F:F
the tulips had the finest colours, and they knew it well, too, for they were standing bolt upright like candles, that one might see them the better. </br>	N:N
you can look into the room from where you stand, and see where i was master once; for i was indeed master to the housekeeper. </br>	N:N
"little benjamin said: ""it spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree."" </br>"	N:N
an hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief to wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he walked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he stirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him. </br>	N:N
tsing-pe! cried the lord-in-waiting, and again he ran up and down stairs, through all the halls and corridors; and half the court ran with him, for they did not like the idea of being trampled upon. </br>	F:Sa
"then the man said, ""what else should i wish for but eternal happiness, and that we two, as long as we live, may be healthy and have every day our daily bread; for the third wish, i do not know what to have."" </br>"	H:N
the two women walked very slowly. </br>	N:N
flopsy, mopsy, and cotton-tail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries; </br>	N:N
it was the grave of galileo. </br>	N:N
six glow-worms gave as much light as they could; but in other respects it was all very quiet; for the old snails could not bear festivities or a crowd. </br>	N:N
he had half a dozen houses, but he was seldom at home. </br>	N:N
"the king said, ""there is no mercy. </br>"	D:N
hi! who invited you? said the little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. </br>	H:N
"gout in my back, ugh."" </br>"	D:N
"the little boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say kindly to him, ""my son, will you have an apple?"" but she gave him a wicked look. </br>"	A:A
i am a poor girl, and i am rinsing yarn. </br>	N:N
next morning, the strange journeyman was to begin to work, but when the master brought the glowing bar, and the youth struck his first blow, the iron flew asunder, and the anvil sank so deep into the earth, that there was no bringing it out again. </br>	N:N
"do not forget that we have a christening today!"" and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but was also held fast to it. </br>"	Su-:N
your name and profession? asked the sentry of the one who alighted first from the carriage. </br>	N:N
"then she took something else off a clothes-horse--""that isn't my pinny?"" said lucie. </br>"	N:N
as soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy. </br>	N:N
"husband, said she, ""say no more about it, but go and try! </br>"	A:N
thank you, old witch, said the soldier. </br>	H:N
what must i do? asked the peasant. </br>	N:N
the woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through a crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his axe, and gave his wife a scythe. </br>	F:F
now when she heard that they were so happy, and so well off, envy and hatred rose in her heart and left her no peace, and she thought of nothing but how she could bring them again to misfortune. </br>	A:A
now he has the cross of honor. </br>	N:N
they had only a few more hours to remain together, for christina was obliged to return that evening to the neighboring village, to be ready for the carriage which was to start the next morning early for herning. </br>	N:N
"then i will go out too, she said, ""and see if it will lighten my misery, for i feel as if the world were coming to an end."" </br>"	F:F
"but she only answered, ""a nice thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,"" and passed on. </br>"	D:N
"it sounds up from the ""bell-deep"" in the odense-au. </br>"	N:N
"what does the good-for-nothing want in the parlour? said they; ""they who would eat bread should first earn it; away with the kitchen-maid!"" </br>"	D:D
sometimes, when her father had to go as far as the town, he would take little christina, who was a year younger than ib, across the heath to the cottage of jeppe jans, and leave her there. </br>	N:N
"at home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful house, and the peasants said: ""the small peasant has certainly been to the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in shovels."" </br>"	H:N
she turned and glanced at the moon, which had risen behind her. </br>	N:N
the stone began to give way under his feet, and sank slowly down into the depths. </br>	N:N
"at last the prince had his own statue erected on the public places and fixed on the royal palaces; nay, he even wished it to be placed in the churches, on the altars, but in this the priests opposed him, saying: ""prince, you are mighty indeed, but god's power is much greater than yours; we dare not obey your orders."" </br>"	D:A
at last the rope gave way with such a sudden jerk that it nearly pulled his teeth out, and quite knocked him over backwards. </br>	Su-:Su-
"its all gone, and ""what can""t be cured must be endured"","" said catherine. </br>"	Sa:A
"yes, i must make an effort to see him again."" </br>"	N:N
it was taken on board (for peter jensen was one of the crew) the very same ship in which the young mate was to sail. </br>	N:N
when mr korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but the cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to wash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and when he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all over his face and eyes. </br>	N:N
"on this the girl said, ""then i will break my little water-pitcher,"" and she broke her little water-pitcher. </br>"	N:N
"tell us something."" </br>"	N:N
but the king made the most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden, like the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling, like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a mantle of a thousand furs was made. </br>	N:N
"shall i ever get in there?

when he was led forth to die, he begged a last favour of the king. </br>	F:Sa
how vividly were represented to him, in a glittering tear that rolled down his cheek, two children at play- a boy and a girl. </br>	N:Sa
no one cares for me, nor troubles himself about me; and i have enough to do to sew my grave clothes. </br>	Sa:N
he drew it quickly out again, but saw that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold off again, all was to no purpose. </br>	F:N
there they both sat like a king and queen under the sweet-smelling tree, which looked exactly like an elder-tree, and he told his wife the story of the elder-tree mother as it had been told him when he was a little boy. </br>	N:N

out of his box, in which were the most beautiful colours, the old man took a quantity of shining leaf-gold, while the boys had to go and fetch some white of egg, with which the sparrow was to be smeared all over; the gold was stuck on to this, and the sparrow-mother was now gilded all over. </br>	N:N
"here he is, master, said he, ""i have got the better of him"": and when the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. </br>"	H:H

a large gilt frame surrounded it, and on one corner of the frame a laurel wreath had been hung; but a black band, twined unseen among the green leaves, and a streamer of crape, hung down from it; for within the last few days the young artist had- died. </br>	Sa:N
while she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed. </br>	N:N
the newspaper and the churchyard were always exciting objects to me. </br>	N:H
but the children could neither hear nor understand this, nor should they; for children must not know everything. </br>	N:N
when we arose, i saw my mother standing by the church door, weeping. </br>	H:Sa
so they sent for sophy, and she was taken into the house to reside with them, and her presence there was a great advantage. </br>	N:N
nothing was to be seen but an open meadow, surrounded by a few bushes, through which ran a broad canal or stream. </br>	N:N

the bean thanked him most prettily, but as the tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam. </br>	H:H
there lay the beautiful, blooming girl, dreaming of him whom she loved so, and who was now, she supposed, travelling far away over mountain and sea. </br>	N:N

if you would do me any good i would willingly tell you, said the merchant. </br>	N:N
when the snow-flakes came down against the small leaded window- panes and shut out the light, the tailor had done his day's work; all the silk and satin lay cut out upon the table. </br>	N:N

he was certainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. </br>	F:F

"scarcely were the words out of the boy""s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for. </br>"	N:N
the children danced round the grave, and the eldest of the boys among them, a practical youngster of seven years, made the proposition that there should be an exhibition of puggie's burial-place for all who lived in the lane; the price of admission was to be a trouser button, for every boy would be sure to have one, and each might also give one for a little girl. </br>	N:N

but the trout was so displeased with the taste of the mackintosh, that in less than half a minute it spat him out again; and the only thing it swallowed was mr. jeremy's galoshes. </br>	N:D
but when he saw what a quantity of silver money it contained, he very quickly threw away all the coppers he had taken, and filled his pockets and his knapsack with nothing but silver. </br>	N:N

then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. </br>	H:H
it was a leaf torn out of an old book, a book that ought not to have been torn up, for it was full of poetry. </br>	N:N
i wish it were a little pussy cat, she said. </br>	N:N

you know she always dances when she hears music and singing of any sort; so she began to dance immediately, although she ought not to have done so, but she could not get into the right time because the tune was so slow; so she stood first on one leg and then on the other, and bent her head very low, but it would not suit the music. </br>	N:N

"the last rays of the setting sun shone upon her, and gleamed over the altar upon the shining clasps of the bible, which lay open at the words of the prophet joel, ""rend your hearts and not your garments, and turn unto the lord."" </br>"	N:N
"they do not know that i am her husband; they will think i have been commanded to stand here, which is quite aristocratic;"" and so he continued standing on one leg. </br>"	N:N
it was a very little person who spoke. </br>	N:N
"no one was there; the third sparrow, seeing this, flew still farther into the room, exclaiming, ""all or nothing! </br>"	N:N
a jolly old sow once lived in a sty, three little piggies has she, &c. </br>	N:N
"father, he replied, ""do listen to me. </br>"	N:N
then she began to think of the expense, and what the distance would be to walk. </br>	N:N
he looked around at the birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then should he find out which was his jorinda? </br>	F:N
this is a shelter for robbers, if they come home and find thee, they will kill thee. </br>	F:N
it had chimed for weddings and for christenings; it had tolled for funerals, and to give the alarm in case of fire. </br>	N:N
the bear put them in his mouth, but could get nothing out of them, let him bite as he would. </br>	A:N
the tones went forth over the wide ocean to every part of the round world. </br>	N:N

when any young man came within a hundred paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. </br>	A:N
now i can imagine that this same idea may prevent him from resting quietly in his grave; for suppose that to produce a good effect, it is necessary to bring out his new idea at breakfast, and that he can only make his appearance on earth at midnight, as ghosts are believed generally to do; why then this good idea would not suit the hour, and the man would have to carry it down again with him into the grave- that must be a troubled grave. </br>	N:N
then she discovered in what state of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained of her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of her husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. </br>	Sa:Su-
mrs. tittlemouse began to pull out the moss. </br>	N:N
so that is a burning mountain; but is it not very dangerous to the people who live near it? </br>	N:N
where am i going now? thought he. </br>	F:N
it was his own fault; but it was a china plate, the last of the dinner service that had belonged to his grandmother, old vixen tod. </br>	N:N
ah, well, so it is; then i was but a child, and now i am old, as old as preben schwane then was. </br>	N:N
a rolling pin? said ribby. </br>	N:N
then he perceived an aged woman with a head which nodded perpetually, who came towards him, but she was a witch. </br>	N:N
tom was very naughty, and he scratched. </br>	N:A
the road led him up a mountain, and when he had reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking peacefully about him. </br>	H:N

he went to bed early, and told pigling upon no account to disturb him next day before twelve o'clock. </br>	N:N
and the mole fell in love with her because she had such a sweet voice; but he said nothing yet, for he was very cautious. </br>	H:N
"now sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd""s old three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air. </br>"	N:F
hallo! shouted jack the dullard. </br>	H:N
mrs. mcgregor untied the sack and put her hand inside. </br>	N:N
the little letter contained within it was discovered, taken out, and turned and twisted in every direction; but the people could not understand what was written upon it. </br>	N:N
"so on they went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher""s shop, the sparrow said to the dog, ""stand there a little while till i peck you down a piece of meat."" </br>"	N:N
"when they were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: ""as you are so clever, you shall sit by me."" </br>"	N:H
nutkin became more and more impertinent-- </br>	N:N
she took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house. </br>	N:N
"fool! said the woman, ""that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney."" </br>"	A:A

the bright warm sunshine streamed through the window into the pew where karen sat, and her heart became so filled with it, so filled with peace and joy, that it broke. </br>	H:H
and she went quickly up to the church-door; but when she came there, the red shoes were dancing before her, and she was frightened, and turned back. </br>	F:F
what strange conduct, said the emperor, when her flight had been discovered; and all the courtiers blamed her, and said she was a very ungrateful creature. </br>	Su-:A
he had his knapsack on his back, and a sword at his side; he had been to the wars, and was now returning home. </br>	N:N
the thoughts seem to become words, and to sound far out into the world. </br>	N:N
it remained on the shore covered with boards,- a noah's ark that never got to the water- whir-r-r-r- and that was a pity. </br>	N:N
the fire-drum and all the other drums were beating, for war had come. </br>	N:N
"nay, said the bird, ""i do not sing twice for nothing. </br>"	N:N
many thanks, you good soul, she said to martha. </br>	H:N
but the tulips stood more stiffly than ever, their faces were pointed and red, because they were vexed. </br>	A:A
when the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow, who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. </br>	H:H
"dont eat too much!"" </br>"	N:N
"then the soldiers and all the people were afraid, and cried, ""good soldier, you shall be our king, and you shall marry the beautiful princess."" </br>"	N:N
it was only of these that she thought when the clergyman laid his hand upon her head and spoke of the holy baptism, of the covenant with god, and told her that she was now to be a grown-up christian. </br>	N:N
in the little corner, where his bed lay, he was over-shadowed as it were by perpetual night. </br>	N:N
then they sent for a watchmaker; and, after a great deal of talking and examination, the bird was put into something like order; but he said that it must be used very carefully, as the barrels were worn, and it would be impossible to put in new ones without injuring the music. </br>	N:N
"i heard it all,"" said the wind, ""for i accompanied the gentlemen through the open door of the stable, and strewed stalks of straw, like bars of gold, at their feet. </br>"	N:N
there was not one to be seen! </br>	N:N
so he seized the chest in his hand and lifted it up a little, as if he were going to throw it into the water. </br>	N:N
when the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door all the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each other, and went merrily home. </br>	H:H
down below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling; and then the fat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang-- </br>	N:N
the bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he went back to the roof and sang: </br>	N:N

and the lord's prayer went inaudibly over her lips; she bowed her head, and was so weary that she went to sleep. </br>	N:Sa
a record of this bright display will live in the memory of man, for through it the pupil in the military school was in tears and sorrow. </br>	Sa:Sa
"chanticleer ran to the bride, and said, ""bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then the river will give me water, and the water i will carry to partlet, who lies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut."" </br>"	N:N

"but the wolf had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them and cried: ""we will not open the door, our mother has not black feet like you: you are the wolf!"" </br>"	F:A
so they looked up, and espied the wolf sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal, and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old sultan. </br>	A:A
this bag she filled with buckwheat flour, and tied it round the princess's neck; and then she cut a small hole in the bag, so that the flour might be scattered on the ground as the princess went along. </br>	N:N
she is good for nothing. </br>	D:N
nought was to be seen but the green turfy mound, with the stones on which no runic record has been graven; but at the last sound of the harp there soared over the hill, as though he had fluttered from the harp, a little bird, a charming singing-bird, with ringing voice of the thrush, with the moving voice pathos of the human heart, with a voice that told of home, like the voice that is heard by the bird of passage. </br>	N:N
"why not? answered the peasant: ""but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to himself."" </br>"	Su+:N
"i shall put them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you never go near or meddle with them."" </br>"	N:N
"then the hard-hearted robbers felt pity, and their leader tore up the letter and wrote another, saying, that as soon as the boy came, he should be married at once to the king""s daughter. </br>"	Sa:N
again and again he bawled it out, but as she did not stir he flew into a passion, and threw the glass of mead in her face; it struck her on the nose, and she fell backwards out of the cart, for she was only seated there, not tied in. </br>	A:A
hold! what is that? </br>	N:N
"skins, skins, he cried again, ""who'll buy skins?"" but to all who inquired the price, his answer was, ""a bushel of money."" </br>"	N:N
"i will have them turned out -- ""buzz! </br>"	N:A
they entered the ships and the prince was approaching his own, when god sent a swarm of gnats- one swarm of little gnats. </br>	N:N
"what have you done! said her mother, ""but no one must know about it, so you must keep silence; what is done can""t be undone; we will make him into puddings."" </br>"	A:A
he reached up and put the end of rope, with the hook, over the head of the tester bed, where the curtains ought to hang. </br>	N:N
the chimney was a very big old- fashioned one. </br>	N:N
she fixed her eyes upon him with such a kind and sad expression, just as if she wished to say something to him. </br>	N:Sa
you shall sing only when it pleases you; and i will break the artificial bird into a thousand pieces. </br>	N:N
alas! miserable wretch that i am! cried he. </br>	A:A
"when i know, i will fly directly to her, and propose."" </br>"	N:N
he walked backwards and forwards for such a long time that he made the surface of the ground quite smooth. </br>	N:N
oh! if they did but know, answered the devil. </br>	H:N
then she carefully gathered the apples together in a heap and walked on again. </br>	H:N
she sat in splendid rooms, richly decorated with silk and velvet; not a breath of air was allowed to blow upon her, and no one was allowed to speak to her harshly, for she was nurse to the count's child. </br>	N:N
the miller told him that he could grind there very well by day, but not by night, for the mill was haunted, and that up to the present time whosoever had gone into it at night had been found in the morning lying dead inside. </br>	N:N
"who would have thought you would have been so silly, said he, ""as to put an earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes? but let us have no more crying; i see you are not fit for this sort of work, so i have been to the king""s palace, and asked if they did not want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will have plenty to eat."" </br>"	A:N
the better to hug you with. </br>	N:N
"delightful, indeed! said the hen, ""why you must be crazy! </br>"	D:N
"hark ye! said he, ""my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so i can""t help doing you a kind turn. </br>"	N:H
it belonged to two dolls called lucinda and jane; at least it belonged to lucinda, but she never ordered meals. </br>	N:N
the sparrows assembled in dozens upon the wild vines, and chattered all together as loud as they could, but not about the old house; none of them could remember it, for many years had passed by, so many indeed, that the little boy was now a man, and a really good man too, and his parents were very proud of him. </br>	H:H
he ran in front, singing-- </br>	N:N
so the man went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. </br>	Sa:Sa
i heard it with my own ears, and one has to hear a great deal before they fall off. </br>	N:N
certainly it was rather crooked, rather up and down, one leg thick, and another thin; still it was like the copy, and he was overjoyed at what he had done. </br>	H:H

how peaceful and silent it was as we walked on through the thick, wild thyme, still fragrant, though the sun had scorched the leaves. </br>	H:N
oh, nothing could be more delightful. </br>	H:N
in the evening they came to a large forest, and they were so weary with sorrow and hunger and the long walk, that they lay down in a hollow tree and fell asleep. </br>	Sa:Sa
the guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take them both with him. </br>	F:F

then the scullion ran and told this to the king, who came with his sword and swung it thrice over the spirit, and at the third time, his wife stood before him strong, living, and healthy as she had been before. </br>	N:N
he has great possessions, but still he longs for more- everything must bow before the mighty olaf glob. </br>	N:N

"catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she said, ""well, i suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he has younger legs than i have."" </br>"	N:Su-

the huckster's wife was so bewildered that she took her gold ear-rings out of her ears and put them in her pocket, that she might save something at least. </br>	N:N
then she brushed their fur (this one is mittens). </br>	N:N
so the boy stayed with them, and the woman herself taught him to sew; and he ate well, and slept well, and became very merry. </br>	H:H
and as the old grandfather's spirit followed the next hovering flame, he knew whither it would lead him. </br>	N:N
they slept quietly until early morning. </br>	N:N
no sooner had it touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices outside his window. </br>	N:N
the soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke off a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree. </br>	N:N

the town now appeared small and poor, and the school-boys read in their books, which they carried under their arms, that it contained two thousand inhabitants; but this was a mere boast, for it did not contain so many. </br>	N:N
"i dare not shoot at him, said the huntsman, ""for i should kill the beautiful young lady also."" </br>"	N:Sa
ida looked that way, and saw a slight carnival rod jumping down among the flowers as if it belonged to them; it was, however, very smooth and neat, and a little wax doll with a broad brimmed hat on her head, like the one worn by the lawyer, sat upon it. </br>	N:N

then i rested by borreby, near the glorious wood, where the heron made his nest, the haunt of the wood-pigeons, the blue-birds, and the black stork. </br>	N:N
they had been obliged to put tom kitten into a hot bath to get the butter off. </br>	N:N
"one day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut fuel, he said, ""i wish i had someone to bring the cart after me, for i want to make haste."" </br>"	N:A
"quack? said jemima puddle- duck, with her head and her bonnet on the one side--""quack?"" </br>"	F:N
he folded her hands and read a psalm over the dead woman. </br>	N:N
what a shame to take my horse, and give me only a dry cow! </br>	D:Sa
they bored holes in the deep declivity, and the splashing rain and the thin mist came and crumbled and washed the names away, and the drummer's name also, and that of his little son. </br>	N:N
"then said the little room-door, ""little flea, why art thou screaming?"" </br>"	Su-:N
"hallo?
220:220	n:n	n:n	where are you going to?--pigling bland stared at him vacantly. </br>"	N:N
and when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. </br>	N:N
but we may comfort ourselves by the certainty that the soul, when acting upon its own impulses, is wiser than we are; it is the body that makes it stupid. </br>	N:N
the ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and peeped in. </br>	N:N
as he was thus thinking he let the bridle fall, and the horse began to caper about, so that he was continually disturbed in his meditations, and could not collect his thoughts at all. </br>	N:N
the witch fell into a passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far into the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her sweetheart roland. </br>	A:A
ib sat down to write, but he could not get on at all. </br>	Sa:N
on the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting croaking. </br>	N:N
"as the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully to herself, ""i know he has fallen asleep."" </br>"	D:Sa
"then she said, ""yes,"" and brought in two immense dishes full of food, which would have been enough to satisfy herself and her husband for a week. </br>"	N:N
then he went to the second princess, who had a dragon with five heads to comb, and delivered her also, and to the youngest, who had a dragon with four heads, he went likewise. </br>	N:N
the rich shoemaker in the town took the measure of her little foot in his own room, in which there stood great glass cases full of pretty shoes and white slippers. </br>	N:N
there were also people who made a mistake between the church and the theatre, and that was terrible indeed! </br>	N:N
first there will be a capital roast; then the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there are all the beautiful white feathers. </br>	N:H
in the year 1834 there was an exhibition in the academy of arts at florence. </br>	N:N
"fly about as a butterfly, indeed! what of that.
32:32	d:n	d:-	i have come out of the emperor's stable, and no one there, not even the emperor's horse, who, in fact, wears my cast-off golden shoes, has any idea of flying, excepting myself.
33:33	d:n	d:-	to have wings and fly! why, i can do that already; and so saying, he spread his wings and flew away. </br>"	D:Su-
see, they said, how the sun shines, and the clouds float in the blue sky. </br>	H:N
then we shall not meet, said the king's son, nodding to the poor boy, who went into the deepest part of the wood, where the thorns tore his shabby clothes and scratched his hands, face, and feet until they bled. </br>	N:N
i observed the well-grown ears of the hare; it is a pleasure to me to observe how long they are. </br>	F:H
and the old grandfather nodded again; and the more he looked at holger danske, the more satisfied he felt that he had carved a good image of him. </br>	H:H
"we hear what is called the ""wester-wow-wow""- the peculiar roar of the north sea as it breaks against the western coast of jutland. </br>"	N:N
then he went to the king, and asked for a ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the sea, till they came to the right place. </br>	N:N
the people came from the town, and walked upon it, and they say there were dancing and skating upon it, i believe, and a great feasting. </br>	N:N
what did gretel give you? </br>	N:N
"now, said he, ""how droll things are in this world! </br>"	N:N
"kaela stood silent, but nodded in approbation of what he said, while mamma-in-law made the following confession:- ""it is difficult to follow you; but i go hobbling along after you with my thoughts, though what you say makes my head whirl round and round. </br>"	N:F
the father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone. </br>	H:H
before evening, she was sitting in the poor little room with the laundress. </br>	N:N
when the day came when the corpse was to be buried, he was taken down into the royal vault with it and then the door was shut and bolted. </br>	N:N
"it is only the heat of the weather, said the princess: ""i feel it very warm too."" </br>"	N:Sa
so the forenoon passed. </br>	N:N
the youth was silent, but led his horses to the stable, gave them some oats and hay, and all that they wanted. </br>	N:N
you are going to be married, tiny, said the field-mouse. </br>	N:N
none of them are engaged yet, said their mother, and the beetle maidens tittered again, this time quite in confusion. </br>	N:Su-
will not one knock soon? asked the boy; and the mother smiled while she put elder-tree blossoms into the teapot and poured boiling water over them. </br>	N:H
mrs. mcgregor took hold of the sack and felt it. </br>	N:N
pigling bland, much alarmed, determined to leave at daybreak. </br>	F:F
the first led him to a dark, narrow prison, in which sat a prisoner, a beautiful woman, daughter of christian the fourth, eleanor ulfeld, and the flame became a rose on her bosom, and its blossoms were not more pure than the heart of this noblest and best of all danish women. </br>	N:N
here was a dreadful trouble. </br>	N:N
"it was found at the soldier""s, and the soldier himself, who at the entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back, and thrown into prison. </br>"	F:N
then the wild man went back into the forest, and it was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and their swords flashed in the sun. </br>	H:N
a beetle came creeping forth from the stable, where the farrier had been shoeing the horse. </br>	N:N
upon my word! cried the miller, and went thither, and found the roast meat. </br>	Su+:Su+
"money enough, replied he, ""but your balls are not quite round."" </br>"	Su-:N
she used to go round among the families near, and search out their faults, upon which she preyed with all the envy and malice of her nature. </br>	N:N
"that does not matter, said the old snail; ""has she a house?"" </br>"	N:N
when the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. </br>	H:H
we'll call them all out, and the pieces of furniture too, for they are of mahogany. </br>	N:N
how could i fancy that i should ever be the means of bringing knowledge and joy to man? </br>	H:N
"hans went into the stable, cut out all the calves"" and sheep""s eyes, and threw them in gretel""s face. </br>"	N:N
"you must have my consent to that first, said heinel, ""so please to step in here, and let us talk it over."" </br>"	N:N
then he pushed him in head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after wisdom dangling in the air. </br>	N:Su-
it bewildered him as he thought of it. </br>	Su-:Su-
but the jewel in the head of the toad? </br>	N:N
and therefore i'll crow! </br>	N:N
peter and benjamin flattened their noses against the window, and stared into the dusk. </br>	N:N
"then there was a terrible crash, as of a world crumbling to pieces, and the angel-child was rising from the earth, and holding her by the sleeve so tightly that she felt herself lifted from the ground; but, on the other hand, something heavy hung to her feet and dragged her down, and it seemed as if hundreds of women were clinging to her, and crying, ""if thou art to be saved, we must be saved too. </br>"	N:N
perhaps he is ferrying still? </br>	N:N
"when the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies to discover who was the enemy""s commander-in-chief. </br>"	N:N
"he made a singular remark--""hallo, here's another!"" --seized pigling by the scruff of the neck, and dropped him into the hamper. </br>"	Su+:N
then he put it on the butter tub and the cash box, and they all expressed the same opinion as the waste-paper tub; and a majority must always be respected. </br>	N:N
once upon a time there were four little rabbits, and their names were-- flopsy, mopsy, cotton-tail, and peter. </br>	N:N
my golden treasure, my riches, my sunshine! said the mother; and she kissed the shining locks, and it sounded like music and song in the room of the drummer; and there was joy, and life, and movement. </br>	H:H
"and now all his friends deserted him, they could not walk with him in the streets; but one of them, who was very good-natured, sent him an old trunk with this message, ""pack up!"" </br>"	N:N
"it is wet, and my town is just like a bottle.
55:55	n:n	n:n	by the cork we must go in, and by the cork we must come out again.
56:56	n:n	n:h	in olden times i had beautiful fish, and now i have fresh, rosy-cheeked boys in the bottom of the bottle, and they learn wisdom, hebrew and greek. </br>"	N:N
the dashing of the water against the bulwarks of a neighboring castle could plainly be heard. </br>	N:N
"at that time he was quite smitten with charlotte.
165:165	n:n	n:+	he was always of an aspiring turn.
166:166	n:n	n:+	at that time he was saucy and an enthusiast.
167:167	n:n	n:+	my husband laughed when he heard of the foolish affair, and now our charlotte is a state councillor's wife. </br>"	N:N
we will now follow the career of the old bell. </br>	N:N
at length there came by two peasant boys, who peeped in among the reeds and spied out the bottle. </br>	N:N
"the giant said: ""if you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our cavern and spend the night with us."" </br>"	N:N
the woman dared not say anything; so she placed the things before them, and they both ate of the fish, the meat, and the pastry. </br>	F:N
it was very natural that he should wish to know. </br>	N:N
but when he came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road he took, said to him, he could not be what he said he was, and must go about his business. </br>	N:N
what am i to do? asked the little man. </br>	F:N
many thanks to you then, replied the rats, and they marched off. </br>	N:N
"i am king, it is true; but i begin to be tired of that, and i think i should like to be emperor."" </br>"	D:Sa
the table was covered with a snowy white table-cloth, on which stood a splendid dinner service, and a steaming roast goose, stuffed with apples and dried plums. </br>	N:N
the court was close to a garden, where everything looked blooming. </br>	N:N
two minutes afterwards he sat in a droschky, which was to drive him to christian's haven. </br>	N:N
ten of them are carried away; but olaf hase and two of the youngest men reach the farther side. </br>	N:N
"this wont taste bitter,"" said he, ""but i will just finish the jacket before i take a bite."" </br>"	N:N
who is that? he asked. </br>	N:N
is it not magnificent? said the two old statesmen who had been there before. </br>	H:N
"have you any inclination to go with me?"" </br>"	N:N
"when it was evening the two brothers came and asked how he had got on, and he said, ""pretty well so far,"" and that he had seen no one except at mid-day when a little mannikin had come and begged for a piece of bread, that he had given some to him, but that the mannikin had let it fall and had asked him to pick it up again; but as he did not choose to do that, the elf had begun to lose his temper, and that he had done what he ought not, and had given the elf a beating, on which he had told him where the king""s daughters were. </br>"	N:N
the wind cut through the rigging, and the boat cut through the sea. </br>	N:N
he was not as pale as dead men are, but black as a coal. </br>	N:N
"you must be a witch, catskin, said the cook; ""for you always put something into your soup, so that it pleases the king better than mine."" </br>"	A:A
he had no tears to shed, and he felt no pain; no thought of molly came into his mind. </br>	N:N
these were wonderful and happy moments for the old tree, full of peace and joy; and yet, amidst all this happiness, the tree felt a yearning, longing desire that all the other trees, bushes, herbs, and flowers beneath him, might be able also to rise higher, as he had done, and to see all this splendor, and experience the same happiness. </br>	Sa:H
they clambered to the top of the rising ground, and found themselves on the edge of a declivity, which sloped down to a clear transparent lake. </br>	N:N
"is that the royal palace? cried the bear; ""it is a wretched palace, and you are not king""s children, you are disreputable children!"" </br>"	A:A
"then the sun set, the clouds were as red as fire; it became quiet in the wood; he sank down on his knees, sang an evening hymn and said: ""i shall never find what i am looking for! </br>"	D:Sa
the young snail pair now ruled in the forest, and had a numerous progeny. </br>	N:N
through the night of the grave we gaze upwards beyond the stars to the end of all things. </br>	N:N
then they ceased, and all around became still; not a bird could be heard, they were all at rest, even the owl had not left her hiding place; deep silence reigned on the margin of the wood by the sea-shore. </br>	N:N
"you can still catch the man up, and then you must ask to have three wishes granted to you."" </br>"	N:N
i bring nothing, but would have something given. </br>	Sa:N
he started as he did so. </br>	N:Su+
"she answered, ""yes, i am your dear wife,"" and at the same moment she received life again, and by god""s grace became fresh, rosy, and full of health. </br>"	H:N
he turned round the corner of the street into the little lane that led to the river, where his mother stood in the water by her washing bench, beating the linen with a heavy wooden bar. </br>	N:N
"is the bottle empty?"" and she leaned against the plank. </br>"	N:N
i was so alarmed, that i felt more strength and life than i had done for some time. </br>	F:N
who were they? what did they want? and what did they bring with them? </br>	N:N
when she had finished, they both sat staring at him with their mouths open. </br>	N:N
"see how they sail, said the darning-needle; ""they do not know what is under them. </br>"	N:N
and went on eating without disturbing themselves. </br>	N:N
every corpse is a sphinx of immortality. </br>	N:N
so they felt it would be useless to search any farther. </br>	D:Sa
there's that man can lie down in his warm bed, but he does not do so. </br>	N:N
ah, you learn to long for the drum-skin, drum, dum, dum! said the drum. </br>	N:N
he did not gain one in the war, but it is still more difficult to gain one in this way. </br>	N:N
he was now a golden top, and whirled and danced about till he hummed quite loud, and was something worth looking at; but one day he leaped too high, and then he, also, was gone. </br>	N:N
"when he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and said, ""poor man! how tired you are! </br>"	N:Su-
"and the dwarf married the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after her father""s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters. </br>"	N:H
"then it noticed the little daisy, and nodded to it, and kissed it with its beak and said: ""you must also fade in here, poor little flower. </br>"	Sa:N
it will come again to-morrow, and most likely teach you to run down into the ditch by the well; for i think the weather is going to change. </br>	N:N
he never stopped till he came to the other side of the wood. </br>	N:N
it was terrible! </br>	Sa:A
and now the best food was cooked for poor hansel, but gretel got nothing but crab-shells. </br>	N:Sa
"they went along the sandy passage--""tiddly, widdly--"" ""buzz! </br>"	N:N
what was to be done? </br>	N:N
"then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so rich that his brother""s fortune could not at all be compared with his. </br>"	N:H
it was thorwaldsen's museum. </br>	N:N
not far from the wood was a ravine through which he had to pass, so he first drove the horses on, and then stopped them, and went behind the cart, took trees and brushwood, and made a great barricade, so that no horse could get through. </br>	N:N
now we are in the churchyard. </br>	N:N
the birch-tree was the quickest of all. </br>	N:N
"when the shameful deed was done, she said, ""now let us return home, and say that he died on the way. </br>"	H:N
"no, certainly not, replied the student; ""but they can make signs. </br>"	N:N
the next morning his back was very sore, which was all he gained by the goloshes of fortune. </br>	N:N
if i could only get some, too, thought little claus; and then, as he stretched his neck towards the window he spied a large, beautiful pie,- indeed they had a glorious feast before them. </br>	N:N
meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should come back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining gold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode straight up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must let him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was not the right one; and that they must send him away at once. </br>	H:N
farewell, farewell, whispered the little elf. </br>	N:N
first she scrubbed their faces (this one is moppet). </br>	N:N
just as he was going out of the iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so quickly upon him that it snapped off a piece of his heel. </br>	Su-:N
she said; could he not bear even such a little peck as i gave him? </br>	D:N
"alack, said the tailor, ""i have my twist; but no more strength--nor time--than will serve to make me one single buttonhole; for this is christmas day in the morning! </br>"	Sa:Sa
nibble, nibble, gnaw, who is nibbling at my little house? </br>	A:Su-
the rest thought of this fact also, although they did not express it, for there were so many other things to talk about. </br>	N:N
she plucks the withered leaf from the balsam, and looks at the grass-covered rampart, on which many children are playing. </br>	Sa:N
she was fat and heated, yet she could use her hands well, and would herself carry out beer to the laborers in the field. </br>	N:N
"but the lazy girl answered, ""do you think i am going to dirty my hands for you?"" and walked on. </br>"	D:N
gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was forced to do what the wicked witch commanded. </br>	Sa:Sa
who is humpty dumpty? asked the little mice. </br>	N:N
the old rough doll, with the broken mouth, stood up and bowed to the pretty flowers. </br>	N:N
and it's not every one who falls so cleverly as i did, and gets away with whole legs and whole bones. </br>	N:N
"then the youngest daughter said again, ""i am sure all is not right--did not you hear that noise? </br>"	F:F
"how he did gnash his teeth and cry out to the bits of wood and straw, ""stop him, stop him; he has not paid toll, and has not shown his pass."" </br>"	N:N
the coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected to eat again for a month. </br>	H:H
"in the peasant's cottage the violin sounded, and games were played for apple quarters; even the poorest child said, ""it is beautiful in winter!"" </br>"	N:N
sleepeth in her cradle fine. </br>	N:N
she left the hut, went into the midst of the forest, seated herself on a tree, and there passed the night. </br>	N:N
the girl did as she was ordered, but the water drew the hole together, and the boot became full to the top. </br>	N:N
now, you see, this is a little history which will never end; as long as the world exists, there will always be men like these five brothers. </br>	N:N
the rich man had now gained what he wanted, so he rode home, and began to consider what he should wish for. </br>	H:N
golden shoes, replied the beetle. </br>	N:N
but the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was shut in all round. </br>	A:A
"at last one took the other aside, and said, ""that little urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him about from town to town as a show; we must buy him."" </br>"	Su+:H
peter will be greater than i. </br>	N:N
"you suffer, you best and most pious woman?"" </br>"	Su-:Su-
i saw you all in your house opposite, as if you were really present. </br>	N:N
what can he want it for? thought great claus; so he smeared the bottom of the measure with tar, that some of whatever was put into it might stick there and remain. </br>	D:N
"good jams, cheap!"" </br>"	N:N
"darling marguerite daisy, he said to her, ""you are the wisest woman of all the flowers. </br>"	N:N
the boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. </br>	Sa:N
but in the bath-room they had made a fire of such deadly heat that the beautiful young queen was soon suffocated. </br>	N:N
"it's not likely they let you start without.
61:61	n:n	n:n	i am passing the farm.
62:62	n:n	n:n	you may walk with me. </br>"	N:N
then i will try my skill, said the thief, and went and stole her away from under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know it, but went on snoring. </br>	H:H
no; the little girl seized the boy round the waist, and then they flew far into the country. </br>	N:N
his whiskers bristled and his coat collar stood on end with rage. </br>	A:A
anastasia blushed like a young rose, and my mother kissed aphtanides. </br>	H:N
"alas, unfortunate creature that i am! said the princess, ""i wish i had accepted the prince. </br>"	Sa:N
every morning she went into the garden and prayed to god in heaven to bestow on her a son or a daughter. </br>	N:N
but just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old mr fox stirred under the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and mrs fox out of the house. </br>	A:A

in a very few seconds the watchman had travelled more than two hundred thousand miles to the moon, which is formed of a lighter material than our earth, and may be said to be as soft as new fallen snow. </br>	N:N
one of them wished to go home and try on her ball dress, for this very dress and the ball were the cause of her being confirmed this time, otherwise she would not have been allowed to go. </br>	N:N
her countenance glowed, and her eyes were like two stars. </br>	N:N
"see, said she, ""i have bought all these with your yellow buttons: but i did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves and dug them up."" </br>"	H:H
"then i must have been eating mouse!

not a tear came into his eye; he felt he was no longer molly's friend. </br>	Sa:N
then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart roland into a fiddler. </br>	N:N
there was greater mirth and rejoicing than i had ever heard in the halls of the rich baronial house. </br>	N:N
oh, that can be easily managed, said the fairy. </br>	H:N
if they do not, the general will thrust them through with his beak, and kill them. </br>	N:N
"brother will soon be back."" </br>"	N:N
they kept everything for themselves, and not a thread came near the loom, but they continued, as hitherto, to work at the empty looms. </br>	N:N
"i have had a bad dream, answered the grandmother, ""so i seized hold of your hair."" </br>"	N:N
when it grew late, six tall men came in and brought a coffin. </br>	N:N
it was burdock from one end to the other; and here lived the last two surviving snails. </br>	N:N
"amusement, too, is very beneficial.

it was difficult to squeeze the bolster into the mouse- hole; but they managed it somehow. </br>	N:N
it produced the feeling which we experience when we enter a vault at a funeral, on a summer's day; while the hills and the clouds put on that singular green hue which we often notice in old paintings, and look upon as unnatural until we have ourselves seen nature's coloring in the south. </br>	N:N

"for this very reason have i come here, the tailor replied, ""i am ready to enter the king""s service."" </br>"	N:N
she had three days to guess it in, but was so clever that she always found the answer to the riddle given her, before the appointed time. </br>	N:N

there was once an emperor who had a horse shod with gold. </br>	N:N
then the fowls arrived, and the cock was polite enough to-day to keep from being rude. </br>	N:N

neither she nor her husband understood how to economize or save, and the riches brought no blessing with them, because they had not asked for it. </br>	N:N

now at the gate each suitor was provided with a number, and all were placed in rows immediately on their arrival, six in each row, and so closely packed together that they could not move their arms; and that was a prudent arrangement, for they would certainly have come to blows, had they been able, merely because one of them stood before the other. </br>	N:N
"ah! replied the horse, ""justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has forgotten all that i have done for him so many years, and because i can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless i become stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can i have of that? he knows i have none, or he would not talk so."" </br>"	Sa:Sa

benjamin stamped his foot, and bolted. </br>	N:F

she reddened from brow to neck, and answered not a single word; and then strangers came into the room, and one of them was the state councillor's son. </br>	N:N
the mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at peter rabbit and little benjamin bunny. </br>	H:N
they sat side by side, and wished that they might never be obliged to part. </br>	N:N
the child said not a word, nor did she cry; but each time the little door was opened she gave a long, long look into the yard. </br>	N:N

the carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. </br>	A:A

"what do i hear you say!

where do you reside when you are at home? asked the shirt-collar. </br>	N:N
in the kitchen were frogs roasting on the spit, and dishes preparing of snail skins, with children's fingers in them, salad of mushroom seed, hemlock, noses and marrow of mice, beer from the marsh woman's brewery, and sparkling salt-petre wine from the grave cellars. </br>	N:N
the mother was like a fountain of questions; and the daughter, who listened but never spoke, might have passed for the beautiful maid of the fountain. </br>	N:N
i suppose they are of shiny leather? asked the old lady. </br>	N:N
go straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. </br>	N:N

mrs fox went up to her room, shut herself in, and her maid, miss cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. </br>	Sa:N

the old student, was the reply. </br>	N:N
"away with him out of the hall!"" </br>"	D:D
the other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out together, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out upon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree. </br>	Su-:Su-
and as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately king came in with a great retinue. </br>	Su+:N
they entered a long gallery, where the boy had been before. </br>	N:N
but the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder. </br>	H:H
"i am not old, said the fir-tree, ""there are many who are older than i am."" </br>"	N:N
then the farmer went home, and ordered his wife to prepare the food; but the youth ploughed the field which was two acres large, quite alone, and then he harnessed himself to the harrow, and harrowed the whole of the land, using two harrows at once. </br>	N:N
then he descended again, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a strange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service. </br>	N:N
hans comes to gretel. </br>	N:N
"and if one single word falls from thy lips, all thy work will be lost."" </br>"	N:N
"hurrah!"" </br>"	H:N
the king took her in his arms, carried her to his horse, and rode home with her, and when he reached the royal castle he caused her to be dressed in beautiful garments, and gave her all things in abundance. </br>	N:N
neither violence nor stupidity gave him a thought. </br>	N:N
he started back, quite bewildered with the fright which the goloshes of fortune had caused him. </br>	Su+:Su-
"i know of no one who has been here, answered peter, ""but a lame tailor, who is still sitting behind the door."" </br>"	N:N
then they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering diamonds. </br>	N:N
"your house is on fire, mother ladybird!
11:11	su-:n	-:n	fly away home to your children! </br>"	Su-:N
the young wife scolded him, but he said nothing and only sighed. </br>	A:A
so she left the pan on the fire and took a large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. </br>	N:N
an icy hand passed over her head and face, and down towards her heart. </br>	N:N
there was certainly not much pleasure in this kind of flying. </br>	N:Sa
and she told him of the treachery of the old woman who had taken away her three children and hidden them. </br>	N:N
"the master said: ""i will run myself, and fetch the guest."" </br>"	N:N
then he saw a girl who was going towards a small house, and when he came nearer, he saw that the maiden was young and beautiful. </br>	N:N
and he had failed to catch a hen pheasant on her nest; and it had contained only five eggs, two of them addled. </br>	A:N
what is that to thee, you ugly imp? said the prince haughtily, and rode on. </br>	D:A
now some ducks were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a confidential conversation together. </br>	H:N
the stairs are as broad as the staircase of a castle, and as steep as if they led to a church-tower. </br>	N:N
before long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running behind three girls. </br>	Su-:N
"no, said the sun, ""i have not seen it; but i will give thee a casket--open it when thy hour of need comes."" </br>"	N:N
the acting was wonderful, excepting that sometimes they came out beyond the lamps, because the wires were a little too long. </br>	N:N
they could not open the window; and although the young family was alive the little rabbits were quite incapable of letting themselves out; they were not old enough to crawl. </br>	N:N
he always wanted the best of everything, and when he could not manage it otherwise, he did it by magic. </br>	N:N
he had a candle burning still, and the goblin peeped through the keyhole and saw that he was reading in the torn book, which he had brought out of the shop. </br>	N:N
then he would rise from his bed, creep down the ladder- for it could scarcely be called a flight of stairs- and when he reached the fire-pan not a spark could be seen; so he had just to go back again to bed. </br>	N:N
"then the princess would say, ""he is of no use! </br>"	D:D
so she roved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase ending with a little door. </br>	N:N
and there were smaller boxes to look at, and the piano was opened, and inside the lid were painted landscapes. </br>	N:N
it was evening. </br>	N:N
eleven peddlers' children were named after her, but not of them could sing a note. </br>	N:N
"the tailors had a flag with a pair of scissors supported by two lions, and on the shoemakers' flag there were not boots, but an eagle with two heads, for the shoemakers must have everything arranged so that they can say, ""this is a pair."" </br>"	N:N

when all was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. </br>	N:N
the chimney itself was wide enough inside for a man to stand up and walk about. </br>	N:N
the next day when they awoke, the sun was already high in the sky, and shone down hot into the tree. </br>	N:N

"then they went away again, and the king said to the lion: ""you have lied to me, they walk just like men."" </br>"	Su-:A
the corn-fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests, in the midst of which were deep pools. </br>	N:N

"the king, who had a bad heart, and was angry about the prophecy, went to the parents, and, seeming quite friendly, said, ""you poor people, let me have your child, and i will take care of it."" </br>"	N:A
"the bride answered, ""first run and bring me my little wreath which is hanging to a willow."" </br>"	N:N
he journeys with his warriors on the farther side of the bay, in order that he may help jens glob, now that the bishop is to be summoned before the judgment seat of the highest. </br>	N:N
"she was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself: ""oh dear! how uneasy i feel today, and at other times i like being with grandmother so much."" </br>"	F:Su-

what are these dear soft fluffy things? said lucie. </br>	N:N
"the king then took pity on him, and said, ""you shall be poor no longer. </br>"	Sa:Sa
"well, we will try, answered he; ""but take some butter and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way."" </br>"	N:H
"he was very proud, and said, ""thorwalsden lived close to me, and here i am now, quite comfortable."" </br>"	N:H
there was often a good deal of show in the streets- show that we don't see nowadays, because it has been abolished as too old-fashioned. </br>	N:N
"the third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly: ""if i could but shudder."" </br>"	Sa:N
the wedding festivities lasted a whole week, and the dogs sat at the table, and stared with all their eyes. </br>	N:N
the laundress slipped and tottered through the lane, and round the corner, into the street where the mayor lived; and just as she reached the front of his house, she sank down upon the pavement. </br>	N:N
the grocer, intent upon his newspaper, might have passed them, if his horse had not shied and snorted. </br>	N:N
"he went inside, and said, ""see, what a splendid bird that is; he has given me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself."" </br>"	H:H
and whom do you love? asked aphtanides. </br>	N:N
it is light that adorns me, said the flower. </br>	N:N
there lay fragments of plates, pieces of plaster, rags, old hats, and other rubbish not pleasant to see. </br>	D:N
peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk. </br>	N:N
ib had money now- money which had come to him out of the black earth; and he had christina for his own, after all. </br>	N:N
then she saw that her deliverance was near, and her heart leapt with joy. </br>	H:H
"and yet, thought the bottle, ""men go on a journey that they may see as much as possible, and i can see nothing."" </br>"	N:N
long white curtains shaded the windows of his room, and in the middle of the floor stood a black coffin, in which he now lay in the still sleep of death; his wish was fulfilled, his body was at rest, and his spirit travelling. </br>	N:N
"can you swim?"" </br>"	N:N
"even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a goose upon it for the king""s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly. </br>"	N:Su-
"my word!
19:19	su+:d	+:d	i'll be in it too! cried jack the dullard; and his two brothers burst out laughing at him, and rode away. </br>"	Su+:Su+

thus the prince was appointed imperial swineherd, and as such he lived in a wretchedly small room near the pigsty; there he worked all day long, and when it was night he had made a pretty little pot. </br>	N:N
at last a large bear came walking through the wood. </br>	N:N
"king, what art thou doing now?
76:76	n:n	n:n	sleepest thou, or wakest thou? </br>"	N:N
and he had to sit out in the rain in the worst weather, and get wet to the skin, and let the cold wind dry the clothes on his back afterwards. </br>	N:N
during the whole day the snow man stood looking in through the window, and in the twilight hour the room became still more inviting, for from the stove came a gentle glow, not like the sun or the moon; no, only the bright light which gleams from a stove when it has been well fed. </br>	N:N
when mr. mcgregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him. </br>	Su-:Su-
he comes creeping up behind the trees. </br>	N:N
"after they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, ""stop, stop!"" and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore that the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their carriage. </br>"	Su+:Sa
when spring came, the plant appeared in full bloom: a more beautiful object than any other plant in the forest. </br>	Su+:N
the old church bell had long been quite forgotten, and no one imagined it would ever again be sent to the melting furnace to make it as it was before. </br>	N:N
"i will eat a bit of the roof, and you gretel, can eat some of the window, it will taste sweet."" </br>"	H:H
that's westmorland, said pig- wig. </br>	N:N
"his father said: ""hansel, what are you looking at there and staying behind for? </br>"	D:Su+
"now, drink your tea, said the mother; ""perhaps you will hear a story."" </br>"	N:N
and now the professor of botany presented himself, one who could explain his knowledge in black and white. </br>	N:N
"the prince started at this, and said, ""let me live, and i will change dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my father, and do you give me your shabby one."" </br>"	Su-:F
"if thats all your grief,"" said the huntsman, ""i""ll take there with all my heart""; so he drew her under his cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they were both there. </br>"	H:N
"the wood was got together, and when she was fast bound to the stake, and the fire began to burn round about her, the hard ice of pride melted, her heart was moved by repentance, and she thought, ""if i could but confess before my death that i opened the door."" </br>"	F:N
"eh?
55:55	su-:su-	-:-	what's that?
56:56	su-:n	-:n	what have they been spoiling now? enquired mrs. mcgregor. </br>"	Su-:N
the goloshes, like all persons who wish to do a thing thoroughly, could only attend to one thing at a time. </br>	N:N
oh, how much happier i should be could i change my being and position with him, and pass through life with his humble expectations and hopes! </br>	N:Sa
they carried her to the churchyard, the churchyard in which the poor were buried. </br>	N:N
"the little cock ran to the bride and said, ""bride, you are to give me some red silk; i want to give red silk to the well, the well is to give me some water, i am to take the water to the little hen who is lying on the nut-hill and has swallowed a great nut-kernel, and is choking with it."" </br>"	N:N
and at this moment the warm breath of heaven blows down from the sky. </br>	N:N
and so he had the princess. </br>	N:N
when, however, he came to the dead horse a raven was already sitting on it devouring it. </br>	N:N
the boys in denmark make a song of it, thus:- </br>	N:N
"dont you see,"" said he, ""that if you had stayed with me, you would have got home just as quickly, and would have had another hour""s sleep?"" </br>"	N:N
then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down, caught fire and began to blaze. </br>	F:N
so little claus came down and told the farmer how he had lost his way and begged for a night's lodging. </br>	N:N
and now the juniper-tree began to move, and the branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for joy. </br>	Su-:H
it is written, that a good deed bears a blessing for its fruit; and it is also written, that the wages of sin is death. </br>	N:N
what does he say? </br>	N:N
the forest, on his arrival, had to change its colors when he wished it; and how beautiful are the colors he chooses! </br>	N:N
"when you come to the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, ""here she is!"" </br>"	N:N
further on he came to a room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him joyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound her, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and marry her. </br>	H:H
so, in a single instant, can the consciousness of the sin that has been committed in thoughts, words, and actions of our past life, be unfolded to us. </br>	N:N
"that may never be, thought the miller""s daughter: and as she knew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he asked. </br>"	N:Sa
"now, child, said he to his own daughter, ""what will you have?"" </br>"	N:N
when her song stopped suddenly. </br>	F:N
"when the seven kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: ""the wolf is dead! </br>"	H:H
scarcely, however, had he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was before; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest for what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father, but that they had found the water of life, and had brought it with them. </br>	Su-:N
he wished to be a poet, and he became one. </br>	N:N
"let us leave him that, said the young lady; ""he has already lost his wealth."" </br>"	Sa:N
"the word had not yet been given to fall back, though they might have done so, and perhaps there would have been much sense in it; and now at last the word ""retire"" was given; but our little drummer beat ""forward! march!"" for he had understood the command thus, and the soldiers obeyed the sound of the drum. </br>"	N:N
the child that lay beneath the ocean, and whose spirit could have no rest until it was carried to the churchyard, and until a grave had been dug for it in consecrated ground. </br>	N:N
the story i am going to tell you happened a great many years ago, so it is well to hear it now before it is forgotten. </br>	N:N
"anthony thought it a very beautiful but mournful story; yet he never feared anything so sad would happen to him and molly, as he passed the spot, whistling the air of a song, composed by the minstrel walter, called the ""willow bird,"" beginning- </br>"	N:N
"i will break down the apple-tree, and tear it up by the roots; never more shall it blossom or bear fruit."" </br>"	A:N
the furrier's daughter thought she should never see it again, but she was mistaken. </br>	N:N
you see, that's their life; they exist only for the eye and the nose. </br>	D:N
the earth was soon left far below, and looked, with its mountains and woods, like a cornfield where the plough had made furrows which separated green meadows; soon it looked only like a map with indistinct lines upon it; and at last it entirely disappeared in mist and clouds. </br>	N:N
he spent his evenings preparing wooden soles for skates, for he knew, he said, that in a few weeks these shoes would be wanted for the amusement of skating. </br>	N:N
she had also to experience another grief in seeing alfred marry again, marry sophy, who was nothing at all to look at. </br>	Sa:Sa
certainly there were odd little jagged doorways in the wainscot, and things disappeared at night-- especially cheese and bacon. </br>	N:N
again it is the time of falling leaves and stranded ships. </br>	N:N
they carved shoes and spoons, which paid well; therefore no one could justly call jeppe jans and his family poor people. </br>	N:N
"with all my heart, said partlet, ""let us go and make a holiday of it together."" </br>"	H:H
so he went in, and played away the three groschen also. </br>	N:N
the boy was taken to church, the boy was christened. </br>	N:N
this house was something between a cave, a prison, and a tumbledown pigsty. </br>	N:N
but no screams. </br>	N:N
his mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. </br>	N:N
a confectioner from the town also came out and put up a stall there; then came another confectioner who hung a bell over his stall, which was covered with pitch to protect it from the rain, but the clapper was wanting. </br>	N:N
you must not shout so, said the sentry. </br>	A:N
"what a beautiful pattern!
68:68	h:n	h:n	what fine colours!
69:69	h:n	h:n	that is a magnificent suit of clothes! </br>"	H:N
they bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. </br>	N:N
these birds are called peacocks, and that is 'the beautiful.' </br>	N:N
all went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden saddle. </br>	N:N
and when my mother sang thus, her eyes would become moist; and on the long eyelashes were tears, but she concealed them and watched the black bread baking in the ashes. </br>	Sa:Sa
and with this thought he consoled himself a little. </br>	Sa:H
now, pig-wig, now! said pigling bland. </br>	F:N
our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before, he was now ten times more so. </br>	H:H
"well, this is quite wonderful; i could not have believed that i should be so favored by fortune.
22:22	n:n	n:n	the fern was not wrong with its song of
23:23	n:n	n:h	'snip, snap, snurre, basse lurre.'
24:24	n:n	n:h	but the song is not ended yet, i am sure; it is only just beginning.
25:25	h:h	h:h	how wonderful it is, that after all i have suffered, i am made something of at last; i am the luckiest person in the world- so strong and fine; and how white, and what a length!
26:26	n:n	h:n	this is something different to being a mere plant and bearing flowers.
27:27	h:n	h:n	then i had no attention, nor any water unless it rained; now, i am watched and taken care of.
28:28	n:n	h:n	every morning the maid turns me over, and i have a shower-bath from the watering-pot every evening.
29:29	n:n	h:h	yes, and the clergyman's wife noticed me, and said i was the best piece of linen in the whole parish.
30:30	h:h	h:h	i cannot be happier than i am now. </br>"	H:H
then the little louse fell in and burnt herself. </br>	N:N
"the little louse has burnt herself, the little flea is weeping,
13:13	su-:n	-:-	the little door is creaking. </br>"	Su-:N
after him came several others; but they had all the same luck, and all lost their lives in the same manner. </br>	N:N
it would take too much time to explain, said the stork, flying quickly away. </br>	A:N
but when he arrived there and opened the parlour-door, he saw his wife sitting in the middle of the room on the saddle, crying and complaining, and quite unable to get off it. </br>	A:Sa
"i've got them!
321:321	n:n	n:n	can we get away?
322:322	n:n	n:n	shall we hide, cousin peter? </br>"	H:N
then roland went away, and the girl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved. </br>	N:N
these presents were the best part of the affair, for they could eat the frogs and snakes, which they very quickly did. </br>	N:N
perhaps he had been long laid in the grave, and would never come back to his home, to rule where his mother then ruled. </br>	N:N
and the brothers turned round to see what he could have found now. </br>	N:N
ib was to her both father and mother; her own parents had vanished from her memory, as a dream-picture vanishes alike from childhood and age. </br>	N:N
it has struck, and is fast embedded in the sand; but the rocket apparatus has thrown a rope on board, and formed a bridge from the wreck to the mainland; and all on board are saved, and reach the land, and are wrapped in warm blankets; and to-day they are invited to the farm at the convent of borglum. </br>	N:N
all the inhabitants of the country round about stood in great crowds around the castle, almost under the very windows, to see the princess receive the suitors; and as each stepped into the hall, his power of speech seemed to desert him, like the light of a candle that is blown out. </br>	N:F
next he crept on his hands and knees through an overfilled butcher's shop; there was meat, nothing but meat, wherever he stepped; this was the heart of a rich, respectable man, whose name is doubtless in the directory. </br>	N:N
"the aged king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the king""s own heart, and he soon died. </br>"	Sa:Sa
the fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed. </br>	F:F
i am not in the habit of letting lodgings; this is an intrusion! said mrs. tittlemouse. </br>	A:A
the man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently began to cry. </br>	Sa:Sa
and the wife struck; but she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest. </br>	Su+:Su-
his eyes gleamed, and his hair gleamed too- there was no denying that! </br>	N:N
"how much the bird reminds me of the musical box of the late lamented empress, said an old courtier, ""it has exactly the same tone, the same execution."" </br>"	N:N
"hearts! repeated the portuguese, ""indeed you have, almost as tender as the ducks in portugal."" </br>"	N:N
nothing, nothing; only leave me to myself, he answered but the tears were running down his cheeks. </br>	Sa:Sa
"marriage is a joy and also a torment."" </br>"	N:N
then the midges had been very bad. </br>	A:N
next morning when the child was not to be found, it was whispered among the people that the queen was a man-eater, and had killed her own child. </br>	N:N
the wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. </br>	H:H
there were sounds of song within the bottle, of things it could not understand, of green sunny mountains, where the vines grow and where the merry vine-dressers laugh, sing, and are merry. </br>	N:N
he put on the goloshes, and was soon in the garden, which contained only one plum-tree and one apple-tree; yet, in a town, even a small garden like this is a great advantage. </br>	N:N
if, however, you like gold best, enter the third chamber, where there is another chest full of it. </br>	N:N
the daisy was glad that it was outside, and only a small flower- it felt very grateful. </br>	H:H
"the sun will make you run some day.
17:17	n:n	n:n	i saw him, last winter, make your predecessor run, and his predecessor before him.

"i have a brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world knows him; but because i am poor, everybody forgets me."" </br>"	Sa:Sa
he made his way up the hill; his temper was not improved by noticing unmistakable marks of badger. </br>	A:A
when she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance. </br>	N:N
the youth went into the smithy and asked if he needed a journeyman. </br>	N:N
i have sworn it: my will must be done! </br>	A:N
the rain trickled down his back, and for nearly an hour he stared at the float. </br>	N:N
and when they came back into the kitchen, there lay ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey frock. </br>	N:N
"we will set it beneath the altar, and not touch it until we are really in need of it."" </br>"	N:N
he could sing, and he sang like a bird in the woodland. </br>	N:N
the grocer read them, but still seemed dissatisfied. </br>	D:N
alexander went into squeals of laughter. </br>	H:H
"i have been lucky enough to find it, and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun scorches so that it begins to wither, and i don""t know that i can carry it farther."" </br>"	Sa:N
hallo! what have you got in your sack! asked the farmer. </br>	Su-:N
that is too bad! cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his companion against the tree until it shook. </br>	A:A
the visitor was a neighbor, mrs. ribby; she had called to borrow some yeast. </br>	N:N
"miaw? said the cat when the tailor opened the door, ""miaw?"" </br>"	N:N
"alas, wife! said he, ""cannot you be easy with being pope?"" </br>"	F:N
a great deal darker than in the tunnel, and narrower too, but the tin soldier continued firm, and lay at full length shouldering his musket. </br>	N:N
at length he came to a spot where many beautiful and delightful chairs were standing, and in the midst was a seat all of gold which was set with shining jewels, likewise it was much higher than the other chairs, and a footstool of gold was before it. </br>	N:N
"ah, be silent, said the hostess, ""so many prying persons have already lost their lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight again."" </br>"	F:N
a short time before christmas, the discontented fir-tree was the first to fall. </br>	N:N
"but cut off my feet with the red shoes."" </br>"	N:N
"if he also is placed upon my apron, he cannot hurt you, and you may take from the chest what gold you will."" </br>"	N:N
"the ass placed himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog""s shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat""s head. </br>"	N:N
wilt thou give me lessons? </br>	N:N
he felt what was taking place, and laughed to himself. </br>	H:H
opposite to the old house were more nice new houses, which had just the same opinion as their neighbors. </br>	N:N
