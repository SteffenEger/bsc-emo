one flight out sideways would have undeceived him.	iambic.penta
the massy earth and sphered skies are riven!	iambic.penta
a secret, and that thrushes chide	iambic.tetra
since there's no help, come let us kiss and part;	iambic.penta
on the cold hill's side.	iambic.di
list to the heavy part the music bears,	iambic.penta
a hand that can be clasped no more-	iambic.tetra
vpon the banke, yet wilt thy selfe not passe the flood?	alexandr.iambic.hexa
you have been mine before,--	iambic.tri
where thirsting longing eyes	iambic.tri
as the deathbed whereon it must expire,	iambic.penta
i wonder, by my troth, what thou and i	iambic.penta
of snow upon the mountains and the moors--	iambic.penta
the jabberwock, with eyes of flame,	iambic.tetra
and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,	iambic.penta
when the stars threw down their spears,	iambic.tetra
and on the pedestal these words appear:	iambic.penta
you sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,	iambic.penta
and the mome raths outgrabe.	iambic.tri
no drum nor trumpet peaceful sleeps should move,	iambic.penta
o what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,	iambic.tetra
reason, your viceroy in me, me should defend,	iambic.penta
for then, i, undistrest	iambic.tri
far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,	iambic.penta
by autumn nutters haunted, flourishes	iambic.penta
not so, when swift camilla scours the plain,	iambic.penta
my true account, lest he returning chide;	iambic.penta
but sucked on country pleasures, childishly?	iambic.penta
where no storms come,	iambic.di
how long ago i may not know:	iambic.tetra
that not one hour myself i can sustain.	iambic.penta
but time to make me grieve,	iambic.tri
with their love the breath between them;	troch.tetra
gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,	iambic.penta
and saw from elm-tops, delicate as flower of grass,	iambic.penta
should find brief solace there, as i have found.	iambic.penta
and close your eyes with holy dread,	iambic.tetra
though the sedge is withered from the lake,	iambic.tetra
fast withereth too.	iambic.di
i must stop short of thee the whole day long.	iambic.penta
a stream went voiceless by, still deaden'd more	iambic.penta
those lovers scorne whom that love doth possesse?	iambic.penta
with what strange utterance did the loud dry wind	iambic.penta
arise from their graves and aspire,	chol.iamb
everything said as personal to himself.	iambic.penta
with the hot blood of youth, of love crossed long ago;	alexandr.iambic.hexa
so long lives this, and this gives life to thee.	iambic.penta
and i took all the blame out of all sense and reason,	alexandr.iambic.hexa
and all my pleasures are like yesterday.	iambic.penta
with horrid warning gapèd wide,	iambic.tetra
in me thou seest the twilight of such day	iambic.penta
her hair was long, her foot was light,	iambic.tetra
to sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,	iambic.penta
sure, if that long with love acquainted eyes	iambic.penta
the cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces	iambic.penta
and he will make the face of heaven so fine	iambic.penta
below the thunders of the upper deep,	iambic.penta
then reached the caverns measureless to man,	iambic.penta
with thy black mantle till strange love grow bold,	iambic.penta
i have spread my dreams under your feet;	iambic.tetra
how at once should i know	iambic.tri
and like a guilty thing i creep	iambic.tetra
a savage place! as holy and enchanted	iambic.penta
in motion of no less celerity	iambic.penta
of birth can quench not, that sustaining love	iambic.penta
is not short paine well borne, that brings long ease,	iambic.penta
through caverns measureless to man	iambic.tetra
the source of human thought its tribute brings	iambic.penta
oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs--	iambic.penta
life of life! thy lips enkindle	troch.tetra
think true love acted simple modesty.	iambic.penta
he clasps the crag with crooked hands;	iambic.tetra
singe my white head. and thou, all-shaking thunder,	iambic.penta
i dare not move my dim eyes any way,	iambic.penta
drops flat, and after the great waters break	iambic.penta
"and say, ""would god it came to pass"	iambic.tetra
labor to admit you, but o, to no end;	iambic.penta
the one the other will contain	iambic.tetra
as i foretold you, were all spirits and	iambic.penta
and hermits are contented with their cells,	iambic.penta
flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves,	iambic.penta
down from the causeway heavily to the swamp	iambic.penta
how silently, and with how wanne a face,	iambic.penta
and not another like it could i see.	iambic.penta
long lines of cliff breaking have left a chasm;	iambic.penta
half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,	iambic.penta
to the chamber where	chol.iamb
and a voice less loud, thro' its joys and fears,	iambic.tetra
chryst yf my love wer in my armes	iambic.tetra
be secret and take defeat	iambic.tri
you cataracts and hurricanoes, spout	iambic.penta
as yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend;	iambic.penta
there hath he lain for ages and will lie	iambic.penta
not in lone splendour hung aloft the night	iambic.penta
christmas eve, and twelve of the clock.	iambic.tetra
out naked on the roads, as the books say, and stricken	alexandr.iambic.hexa
leap to these arms untalked of and unseen.	iambic.penta
what's that but to lie	chol.iamb
it will flame out, like shining from shook foil;	iambic.penta
she dotes on what the wild birds say	iambic.tetra
he chortled in his joy.	iambic.tri
westron wynde when wyll thow blow	iambic.tetra
who said: two vast and trunkless legs of stone	iambic.penta
breasting the lofty surge. o, do but think	iambic.penta
that had'st thou sprung	iambic.di
i run to death, and death meets me as fast,	iambic.penta
about her lover.	iambic.di
did gyre and gimble in the wabe;	iambic.tetra
death's second self, that seals up all in rest.	iambic.penta
let us not weigh them. heaven's great lamps do dive	iambic.penta
from less and less to nothing; thus he fell	iambic.penta
straight up and down of tall slim trees	iambic.penta
what candles may be held to speed them all?	iambic.penta
he thought that i was after him for a feather--	iambic.penta
is not great grace to helpe him ouer past,	iambic.penta
who in the dark and silent grave	iambic.tetra
do they above love to be lov'd, and yet	iambic.penta
and further from it daily wanderest:	iambic.penta
and like a laughing string	iambic.tri
her from her lover;	iambic.di
and each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.	iambic.penta
and a few lilies blow.	iambic.tri
by a flash of lightning, or a wave;	iambic.tetra
one thing to be blown up, or fall;	iambic.tetra
and half-inch fissures in the slippery rock	iambic.penta
and shakes this fragile frame at eve	iambic.tetra
who says that fictions only and false hair	iambic.penta
take him and cut him out in little stars,	iambic.penta
her symphony and song,	iambic.tri
hear the shrill whistle which doth order give	iambic.penta
its dim shapes are clad with brightness	troch.tetra
on the bald street breaks the blank day.	iambic.tetra
alone and palely loitering?	iambic.tetra
through wood and dale the sacred river ran,	iambic.penta
whenas in silks my julia goes,	chol.iamb
the one the other will absorb--	iambic.tetra
to such a deep delight 'twould win me,	iambic.tetra
was not ignoble. oh! when i have hung	iambic.penta
and every fair from fair sometimes declines,	iambic.penta
but where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.	iambic.penta
may read in thee;	iambic.di
what the anvil? what dread grasp	iambic.tetra
a roundel is wrought as a ring or a starbright sphere,	chol.iamb
could i revive within me	iambic.tri
by the injustice of the skies for punishment?	alexandr.iambic.hexa
the wood was gray and the bark warping off it	iambic.penta
from many a wondrous grot and secret cell	iambic.penta
while on the perilous ridge i hung alone,	iambic.penta
he went behind it to make his last stand.	iambic.penta
be not disturbed with my infirmity.	iambic.penta
ever to come up with dactyl trisyllable.	chol.iamb
and makes one little room an everywhere.	iambic.penta
give me the lowest place: or if for me	iambic.penta
ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed	iambic.penta
without so much as wishing him good-night.	iambic.penta
the everlasting universe of things	iambic.penta
but fools do live and waste their little light,	iambic.penta
droop herbs and flowers;	iambic.di
by their own beauties; or, if love be blind,	iambic.penta
with the first dream that comes with the first sleep	iambic.penta
i see a lily on thy brow,	iambic.tetra
or snorted we in the seven sleepers' den?	iambic.penta
another day	iambic.di
of the rolling level underneath him steady air,and striding	iambic.penta
my long scythe whispered and left the hay to make.	iambic.penta
faints, entangled in their mazes.	troch.tetra
she dwelt among the untrodden ways,	iambic.tetra
unnumbered and enormous polypi	iambic.penta
far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star,	iambic.penta
as a bird's quick song runs round, and the hearts in us hear	chol.iamb
of earth—and with what motion moved the clouds!	iambic.penta
nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,	iambic.penta
still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,	iambic.penta
slow, slow, fresh fount, keep time with my salt tears;	iambic.penta
so haggard and so woe-begone?	iambic.tetra
may kill as soon as death's cold hand;	iambic.tetra
and there she wept and sighed full sore;	iambic.tetra
nor ever chaste, except you ravish me.	iambic.penta
the breath whose might i have invoked in song	iambic.penta
burnt the fire of thine eyes?	iambic.tetra
when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st;	iambic.penta
batter my heart, three-personed god; for you	iambic.penta
she laughs at them for childishness,	iambic.tetra
nor did it occur to one of us there	iambic.tetra
and blue spurt of a lighted match,	iambic.tetra
a faery's song.	iambic.di
than the two hearts beating each to each!	iambic.tetra
maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,	iambic.penta
thrush, blackbird, all that sing in may	iambic.tetra
drop, drop, drop, drop,	iambic.di
or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf:	iambic.penta
thy grace may wing me to prevent his art,	iambic.penta
but when sleep comes to close each difficult day,	iambic.penta
in the howling storm	chol.iamb
and all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;	iambic.penta
as two in whom they were proved mistaken,	iambic.tetra
not without feeble pointed spikes of flowers	iambic.penta
and pays us but with age and dust;	iambic.tetra
as phaeton would whip you to the west	iambic.penta
the smalle rayne downe can rayne	iambic.tri
high there, how he rung upon the rein of a wimpling wing	iambic.penta
went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind.	iambic.penta
and far away into the sickly light,	iambic.penta
in a vision once i saw:	iambic.tri
travelling across the wet mead to me here,	chol.iamb
and the pile somewhat sunken. clematis	iambic.penta
or free his feet, that in the myre sticke fast?	iambic.penta
and out of the swing of the sea.	iambic.tri
pulse for pulse, breath for breath:	iambic.tri
"our childhood used to know,"""	iambic.tri
leave not a rack behind. we are such stuff	iambic.penta
the squirrel's granary is full,	iambic.tetra
that time of year thou mayst in me behold	iambic.penta
even to the original air-blue gown!	chol.iamb
singing of mount abora.	iambic.tetra
that seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice,	alexandr.iambic.hexa
with rocks and stones and trees.	iambic.tri
close to the sun in lonely lands,	iambic.tetra
and thou like adamant draw mine iron heart.	iambic.penta
and what shoulder, & what art,	iambic.tetra
or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask	iambic.penta
and shuns to have her graces spied,	iambic.tetra
he spent himself, the labor of his ax,	iambic.penta
ease after warre, death after life does greatly please.	iambic.penta
seeking after that sweet golden clime	chol.iamb
and both do aim at human hearts.	iambic.tetra
but let all lovers, rich in triumph, come	iambic.penta
for thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings	iambic.penta
and on thy cheeks a fading rose	iambic.tetra
but thy eternal summer shall not fade,	iambic.penta
fall, gall themselves and gash gold-vermil>sb/>ion.	iambic.penta
but rather to tell how, if art could tell,	iambic.penta
for he on honey-dew hath fed,	iambic.tetra
and in the chasm are foam and yellow sands;	iambic.penta
and lesbia, close up thou my little light,	iambic.penta
within the sonnet's scanty plot of ground;	iambic.penta
what if some little paine the passage haue,	iambic.penta
over the land freckled with snow half-thawed	iambic.penta
we pictured the meek mild creatures where	iambic.tetra
amid a place of stone,	iambic.tri
when yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang	iambic.penta
now dark--now glittering--now reflecting gloom--	iambic.penta
men, women, on their sodden faces, hurled	iambic.penta
and that one talent which is death to hide	iambic.penta
only the monstrous anger of the guns.	iambic.penta
with throbbings of noontide.	iambic.tri
like the fairest, for it folds thee	troch.tetra
perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,	iambic.penta
in cluster; then a mouldered church; and higher	iambic.penta
walk upon the winds with lightness,	troch.tetra
above the raven's nest, by knots of grass	iambic.penta
i warm'd both hands before the fire of life;	iambic.penta
and watching, with eternal lids apart,	iambic.penta
then must we sleep one ever-during night.	iambic.penta
and ghastly through the drizzling rain	iambic.tetra
shake hands forever, cancel all our vows,	iambic.penta
how small a part of time they share	iambic.tetra
the brain is just the weight of god--	iambic.tetra
where souls brim-full of love abide and meet;	iambic.penta
that busie archer his sharpe arrowes tries?	iambic.penta
except you enthrall me, never shall be free,	iambic.penta
the fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.	iambic.penta
and they will differ-- if they do--	iambic.tetra
are with me from the past;	iambic.tri
tell her that wastes her time and me	iambic.tetra
in deserts, where no men abide,	iambic.tetra
a city on the inconstant billows dancing;	iambic.penta
when i consider how my light is spent	iambic.penta
did he who made the lamb make thee?	iambic.tetra
where alph, the sacred river, ran	iambic.tetra
where the traveller's journey is done;	chol.iamb
and the startled little waves that leap	iambic.tetra
of his bones are coral made;	iambic.tetra
the old dog barks backwards without getting up.	chol.iamb
she neither hears nor sees;	iambic.tri
must doff my will as raiment laid away--	iambic.penta
and on her dulcimer she played,	iambic.tetra
but just when at that swallow's soar	iambic.tetra
so rested he by the tumtum tree,	iambic.tetra
saying that now you are not as you were	chol.iamb
i am borne darkly, fearfully, afar;	iambic.penta
the shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells;	iambic.penta
well nigh was helmet-hidden, and the name	iambic.penta
and there i shut her wild, wild eyes	iambic.tetra
where you would wait for me: yes, as i knew you then,	chol.iamb
i saw pale kings and princes too,	iambic.tetra
and true plain hearts do in the faces rest;	iambic.penta
she seemed a thing that could not feel	iambic.tetra
and all feel, yet see thee never,	troch.tetra
divorce me, untie or break that knot again;	iambic.penta
as a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend: the hurl and gliding	iambic.penta
and get knocked on the head for his labours,	chol.iamb
let him think of the glories of greece and of rome,	chol.iamb
to-morrow comes december;	iambic.tri
then, now,--perchance again!	iambic.tri
not in the hands of boys but in their eyes	iambic.penta
weave a circle round him thrice,	iambic.tetra
till all the rafters rang with woman-yells,	iambic.penta
than triumph, turn away	iambic.tri
southward through eden went a river large,	iambic.penta
and from which earth, and grave, and dust	iambic.tetra
pour'd forth profuse on hill and dale and plain.	iambic.penta
"i 
          can remember when he was a pup."	iambic.penta
like to the lark at break of day arising	iambic.penta
that makes fraile flesh to feare the bitter waue?	iambic.penta
that liquefaction of her clothes.	iambic.tetra
or to our end like way may have	iambic.tetra
fall grief in showers;	iambic.di
ah sun-flower, weary of time,	chol.iamb
flies o'er th'unbending corn, and skims along the main.	alexandr.iambic.hexa
i should go with him in the gloom,	iambic.tetra
to warm the frozen swamp as best it could	iambic.penta
from the fountain and the caves.	iambic.tetra
can it be you that i hear? let me view you, then,	chol.iamb
and burbled as it came!	iambic.tri
my sweetest lesbia, let us live and love,	iambic.penta
no--yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,	iambic.penta
deep in the shady sadness of a vale	iambic.penta
to still my beating mind.	iambic.tri
and there repose. a turn or two i'll walk	iambic.penta
if ever any beauty i did see,	iambic.penta
the common fate of all things rare	iambic.tetra
by the embers in hearthside ease.	iambic.tri
come to my arms, my beamish boy!	iambic.tetra
with silken streamers the young phoebus fanning.	iambic.penta
pass'd underneath ingulft, for god had thrown	iambic.penta
i met a lady in the meads,	iambic.tetra
extremes to touch, and mean one thing.	iambic.tetra
confusion of the death-bed over, is it sent	alexandr.iambic.hexa
child of light! thy limbs are burning	troch.tetra
watch the slow door	iambic.di
green in a cuplike hollow of the down.	iambic.penta
i saw the swift's black bow,	iambic.tri
the word the cuckoo cries to his mate	iambic.tetra
rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill	iambic.penta
his ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep	iambic.penta
that lowest place too high, make one more low	iambic.penta
and that was why it whispered and did not speak.	iambic.penta
come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright	iambic.penta
till they fail, as i am failing,	troch.tetra
that mountain as his garden mould high rais'd	iambic.penta
the same year after year--	iambic.tri
i am his highness' dog at kew;	iambic.tetra
despair behind and death before doth cast	iambic.penta
"o frabjous day! callooh! callay!"""	iambic.tetra
and look upon myself, and curse my fate,	iambic.penta
that brave vibration each way free,	iambic.tetra
vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,	iambic.penta
no mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells;	iambic.penta
descends on me; my spirit's bark is driven	iambic.penta
upon those boughs which shake against the cold,	iambic.penta
and the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows;	iambic.penta
and try if we cannot feel forsaken.	iambic.tetra
i have desired to go	iambic.tri
there was never a sound beside the wood but one,	iambic.penta
did he smile his work to see?	iambic.tetra
there trampled out his face from being known,	iambic.penta
from the sight, that liquid splendour,	troch.tetra
sat gray-hair'd saturn quiet as a stone,	iambic.penta
he went galumphing back.	iambic.tri
"no, i will go on farther--and we shall see."""	iambic.penta
embark his royalty; and his brave fleet	iambic.penta
does thy life destroy.	chol.iamb
what immortal hand or eye	iambic.tetra
ringed with the azure world, he stands.	iambic.tetra
in fiery ringlets from their sleep,	iambic.tetra
where i may sit and see	iambic.tri
he gazed and gazed and gazed and gazed,	iambic.tetra
or hint or mock at, night and day,--	iambic.tetra
as i gain the cove with pushing prow,	iambic.tetra
buckle! and the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion	iambic.penta
(pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake.-	iambic.penta
fair are others; none beholds thee,	troch.tetra
standing as when i drew near to the town	chol.iamb
and his dark secret love	chol.iamb
iambics march from short to long.	iambic.tetra
a maid whom there were none to praise,	iambic.tetra
let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone,	iambic.penta
"""and hast thou slain the jabberwock?"	iambic.tetra
not so much life as on a summer's day	iambic.penta
then ev'n of fellowship, o moone, tell me	iambic.penta
but soon as once set is our little light,	iambic.penta
when ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,	iambic.penta
high as the highest peak of furness fells,	iambic.penta
by hearts grown cold to me,	iambic.tri
